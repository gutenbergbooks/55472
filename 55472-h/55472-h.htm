<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

<p>Since the first edition of this book was produced two years ago
popular interest in the sport has increased by leaps and bounds.
We have endeavoured to keep pace with the times, and the
present volume is an attempt to give a really complete account
of the sport, which will be useful to beginners and experts alike.
To the historical part has been added a chapter on Continental
ski-running, whilst the technical part has been remodelled,
enlarged, and, we trust, rendered more lucid and complete.
Wherever necessary new diagrams have been added, and the
whole-page illustrations have been chosen with a view to indicating
the great beauty and variety of the snow regions of the
earth.</p>

<p>Here and there actual alterations of views previously expressed
will be found. We make no apology for these, but desire frankly
to acknowledge our errors, and to thank those friendly critics
who have pointed them out. With ignorant criticism we have
been very little troubled, and with actual hostility simply not
at all.</p>

<p>We are further greatly indebted to the many friends who
have rendered us positive assistance. The frontispiece is from
Herr Halström’s wonderful picture “Paa Skare,” which that
gentleman has given us unqualified leave to reproduce. The
ski-runner which it depicts also serves as a central figure for the
cover, designed by Mr. Nico Jungman. To those who have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span>
kindly permitted us to copy their photographs we hereby take
the opportunity of expressing our best thanks. The outline of
the Solberg Hill is from an accurate drawing by Herr Von de
Beauclair published in <i>Ski</i>, to the editor of which paper we are
also indebted for the drawings illustrating Herr Sohm’s detachable
seal’s-skin and climbing-irons. To Herr S. Höyer-Ellefsen,
Herr Fredrik Juell, Herr Trygve Smith, Herr Durban Hansen,
and numerous other skilful Norwegian runners we are grateful
for many a useful hint and word of advice, whilst we owe to
Herr Zdarsky a valuable practical demonstration of his methods
of teaching. Messrs. C. W. Richardson, E. H. Wroughton, and
H. P. Cox have been kind enough to help with the actual production
of the little work, and if there be any others who we
have omitted to mention we would hereby beg them to accept
at once both our apologies and thanks.</p>

<p>There are many people to whom the word “ski” must be an
enigma, and everything connected with the pastime “ski-ing”
as a sealed book. The object of the present treatise is, therefore,
to solve the puzzle, open the pages of the closed volume, and
thus throw light on a sport which, when once learnt, will be
found more attractive, healthy, and invigorating than any other
winter exercise, provided, of course, that it be not carried on (as
often is the case) to excess, but is indulged in only by those who
are sound of wind and limb.</p>

<p>For the sake of the uninitiated, it may be explained that
<i>ski</i> (pronounced she) is a word of foreign origin, which, up to
comparatively recent years, has been translated “snowshoe,”
a term which conveys a wrong idea of the appliances in question,
even supposing it might be more fitly given to the forerunners
of the ski, viz., pattens formed of withes or wood, which are
used in many parts at the present day, and of which the Indian
or Canadian snowshoe is a modified type, and best known to
British sportsmen.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The ski, however, are of different construction,
being formed of narrow boards, 7ft. and more in length,
upturned at the toe to allow of their being shoved or slid over
the snow, when attached to the feet of the wearer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>With the exception of snow skates (iron shod runners some 2ft.
in length, for use on roadways and hard surfaces) they are the
only kind of foot gear used for the purpose of gliding on snow,
and possess many advantages over other snowshoes, not the
least being their capability of being used for pleasure, as well
as the necessary outdoor pursuits of daily life.</p>

<p>Until comparatively late years the employment of ski as
contrivances for travelling on the snow was unknown to the
majority of those inhabiting the more populated parts of the
civilised globe, where communication can nearly always be kept
open by rail, steamboat, or other means; notwithstanding that
they are, and have been used from time immemorial during
many months of the year by a large portion of the population of
Northern and Central Asia, Russia, Scandinavia, and even the
southern parts of Eastern Europe, where the winters are severe.
Casual allusions to them in the writings of some few sporting
authors did not suffice to bring the ski into other than mere
passing notice; and they would probably have remained in
obscurity but for the somewhat recent discovery that they could
be employed for other purposes than those of mere locomotion,
or keeping open communication in lands and districts where
snows are deep, and highways lie buried or are unknown.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to mention here that, in remote parts
of England, ski appear to have been employed so late even as
the middle of the past century, their use being discontinued as
communication with the outer world became easier. Thus, apart
from information derived from other sources respecting finds of
ski, or their remains in various parts, one gentleman, writing
from Cumberland in February, 1904, states that, in the dales of
Yorkshire and Durham, the sport is by no means new, and that
forty years ago he went to his school on “skees,” which were made
of beech wood, some 5ft. in length, with “nibs” about 3in., and
that it was no uncommon practice in those days for the Weardale
miners to go to and from their work on such snowshoes, it being
a fine thing to see thirty or forty men gliding down the steep
slopes from the mines at a speed equal to that of a railway train.
The writer also adds that, amongst the youths, skee-jumping was
a favourite pastime, and that he believes the practice was a very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
old one from the fact that he knew boys of his own age who had
come into possession of “skees” once owned by their grand-fathers.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>To judge from the description given by the author of “Lorna
Doone,” a form of ski was, probably, known in Devonshire some
300 years ago, where also sledges were employed throughout the
entire year instead of wheeled vehicles for carting in farm
products. In the story he relates how when, during the great
frost of 1625, John Ridd was told that, in the Arctic regions, any
man might get along with a “boat” on either foot to prevent
his sinking in the snow&mdash;such “boats” being made very strong
and light, of ribs with skin across them, 5ft. long by 1ft. wide,
and turned up at each end, even as a canoe is&mdash;he built himself a
pair of strong and light snowshoes, framed of ash, and ribbed of
withy with half-tanned calf skin stretched across, and an inner
sole to support his feet. “At first,” he says, “I could not walk
at all, but floundered about most piteously, catching one shoe in
the other, and both of them in the snowdrifts (just as a
beginner would now), to the great amusement of the maidens
who were come to look at me.”</p>

<p>From the above description such ski would have resembled
those of the Chukchis in North-East Asia.</p>

<p>It is due, however, to the youth of Norway that ski-ing has
of late years been reduced to a pleasure and an art; while the
notice it has received abroad is owing mainly to the prominence
given to it by accounts furnished to, and published in, English
sporting and illustrated journals, and to allusions to it in the
writings of various arctic explorers who have lately taken ski
with them on their journeys as part of their travelling outfit.</p>

<p>In turning to the history of the ski, it will be found that
their origin is as much lost in oblivion as that of the wheel; but
it is not too much to assume that human beings who have been
created to adapt themselves to their surroundings at all times,
have, in lands far separated and entirely apart, invented somewhat
similar appliances with which they could float, as it were,
and proceed over depths of snow that would otherwise bury
them, or cross tracts of treacherous ice which would give way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
under the tread of a human foot. In this connection one need
not refer solely to inhabitants of wintry countries, for it will be
found that the natives of other regions, who have to traverse
yielding surfaces, such as the great mud flats of Hampshire and
elsewhere, wear pattens on their feet, and are thus able to
wander in safety over a substance too soft to bear them otherwise.
Such pattens are almost identical with those employed
elsewhere for travelling over snow, and consist of slabs of wood,
some 16in. to 18in. long, by 12in. or so in width, which are
attached to the feet by toe straps and thongs. In these pattens,
no matter whether they be made of withes or solid wood, we
undoubtedly find the earliest form of snowshoes or ski, a form
which, however, exists to the present day, and is met with in
the north-eastern and northern portions of Asia, Thibet, the
Caucasus, Armenia, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, and, in
a modified form, in North America, the principle of construction
there being identical, viz., a ring or framework of wood supporting
a net work of withes or sinews. There are, however, various
modifications of the original round pattern; some of the shoes,
possibly to prevent straddling, are more or less elongated, the
length being increased as the breadth is diminished, while some,
thus shaped, have occasionally leather stretched between the
frames to allow of their wearer gliding, instead of walking, over
the snow, and thus become veritable ski; for while the original
object of the snowshoe or patten and the ski are identical, viz.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>-
to support a weight on yielding surfaces, the patten remains a
shoe for walking purposes, while the ski becomes a blade on which
to slide. From this explanation the difference between patten
or snowshoe and ski is possibly made clear for the first time.</p>

<p>While, as previously mentioned, it is impossible to trace the
origin of the ski, mention of snowshoes is made hundreds of
years before the Christian era. Xenophon refers to their being
worn (as in Scandinavia to the present day) by the horses of the
Armenians to prevent their sinking in the deep snow. Historical
mention, from a period before Christ, is also made of the mountaineers
of the Caucasus attaching discs of leather (probably
leather-covered wood), studded with nails, to their feet to enable
them to move over the snows of the fells. The ancient accounts,
however, all refer to the patten, but Norwegian traditions dating
back some 1,600 years make mention of the ski. The Greek
historian, Prokopius, as well as other writers, including King
Alfred of England, from 550 <small>A.D</small>. to 1070 <small>A.D</small>., drew attention
to the Lapps, who were called “Skrid Finner,”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> one saying
they were the best of all men at ski-ing, and the fact of it being
the Lapps who wore the ski, or who were the great exponents
of ski-ing in those early times, would tend to confirm the theory
of the ski themselves originating in Central Asia&mdash;those parts
of the old world from which the Ugrians or Finns, Samoyeds,
and other tribes of Mongols migrated northward and westward,
till stopped by the waters of the Atlantic on the shores
of the Scandinavian peninsula. There can be little doubt, however,
that pattens were used for hundreds, if not thousands, of
years before the thought of sliding over the snow, which led to
the introduction of ski, entered the head of some inventive
genius. The original ski were probably constructed by the
Chukchis, or similar tribes, near the Behring Straits, or Sea of
Okhotsk. They were formed, as already intimated, of elongated
frames covered with leather, and were modified, subsequently,
as migration increased, forests were met with, and wood was
found to be a better and more durable material for the purpose
required.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that ski were extensively used in olden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
times by the Scandinavians as well as others. They also found
their way from Norway to Iceland and Greenland. Of ski there
are many types. The skridsko (sliding shoes), or ski of the
Lapps, appear, if one is to judge from old illustrations from the
sixteenth century (Figs. 2 and 3), to have been veritable shoes,
the feet being placed in a hole made for the purpose at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
heel of the ski. They are thus depicted as elongated (some
3ft. long) sabots. There is, however, no reason for assuming
these sabot skis to have been the original form, for they
were, at best, but a hybrid type of ingenious construction,
possibly only used by the inhabitants of certain districts. The
true Lapps’ ski, on the other hand, were comparatively short
and broad, attached to the feet by toe straps and thongs, and
covered with the skins of reindeer calves for the purpose of
letting them glide easily without accumulating snow on the
soles, of keeping the wood from splitting or fraying, and
because, when thus covered, it was easier to ascend the slopes
of the hills, the hairs which lay fore and aft, checking the
tendency to slide backwards.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Skrid-Finner (Olaus Magnus, <i>ca.</i> 1550).</p></div>

<p>Such skin-clad ski were, and are still, employed by the
Lapps, as well as by others in Scandinavia, Finland, and
throughout Siberia; but several other types have, nevertheless,
been used in Lapland for centuries. In Scandinavia and the
North, these skin-covered appliances go by the name of
“aandre,” “ondurr,” “andor,” to distinguish them from the
plain ski. As, however, the advantages of the skin are not
now generally considered sufficient to counterbalance the
disadvantages, they are gradually disappearing.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt but that the greatest development
of the ski has taken place in Europe, notably in Scandinavia,
where they have been modified to suit the different requirements
of the districts in which they are employed. Thus have
the varied types hitherto been many, but may be divided
generally into two groups, viz., the short and broad, or loose
snow ski, and the long and narrow, or compact snow variety
(“skare ski”), this latter pattern being represented by the
Oesterdal and Swedish ski (originally one very long and one short
ski, but now generally of equal length). These are the most
suitable for open country, whether in the lowlands or mountains,
and on level or undulating land are superior, so far as
speed is concerned, to all others; but in broken country, or
on mountains where obstacles such as trees, rocks, &amp;c., are to
be met with, the shorter or “loose snow” patterns, owing to
their handiness, are invariably employed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span></p>

<p>Almost every province, it may be said almost every district,
throughout Scandinavia possessed its own type of ski. In
Russia they have possibly been of a more homogeneous character
than elsewhere, owing to the snow-clad portions of that empire
consisting of vast plains which call for no variety of form.
Of comparatively late years, however, there has been a tendency
in Norway to adopt one sort for universal use, and a sub
(lighter) variety for leaping purposes. It is a modified Telemarken
(loose snow) type, eminently suited to every purpose,
and is gradually superseding all other forms throughout
Scandinavia.</p>

<p>Of accessories to the ski, the staff has invariably been
recognised as a necessity (except in leaping competitions, when
it becomes a source of the greatest danger) and should always
form part of the outfit on all long excursions or journeys. It
assists the skier both in aiding him when ascending, and as a
brake when descending difficult slopes, or as a means of defence
if attacked by animals. The Lapps use it, too, as an offensive
weapon when attacking wolves, which they occasionally run
down on their ski, and kill by a well-directed blow on the
snout, or across that most vulnerable spot, the loins of the
beast. The most effectual use of the staff can only be learnt
by experience or teaching. The fastenings may be regarded as
other important accessories, and but a few years ago, and in
many parts even still consist solely of toe straps formed of
withes or leather. These simple contrivances suited all the
requirements of the expert peasants, and it is only of late years,
when leaping was introduced, and the ski put to other and
harder purposes than originally intended, that stronger and
more secure bindings became necessary. Of these, there are
many sorts, all good, but none perfect as yet. In some instances
the latter may be a source of great danger owing to its being
impossible, when peril faces one, or accidents occur, to remove
the ski from the feet, and notably so when a man breaks
through treacherous snow-covered ice, owing to the ski preventing
him from regaining the surface. But while several
fatal accidents have occurred in this manner, it is possible that
others have been avoided by the greater command of the ski
afforded to most people by secure fastenings.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p></div>

<p>Having now given an outline of the history and origin of the
ski, it may be well to refer to the movement by which ski-ing
has been brought into the prominent notice of sportsmen and
admirers of winter pastimes. In the extensive and mountainous
district of Telemarken, Norway, one in which ski were
employed possibly more extensively than in any other, owing to
its remoteness, and the wretched state of the few highways and
byways to be found there, the peasants discovered that the
ski might be used for pleasure as well as ordinary pursuits, and
arranged meetings at which races were run, and the leaping
powers of competitors tested on the slopes of selected hills. By
degrees news of these trials of skill found its way to the towns
and the populated districts in their neighbourhood, and some
few citizens having found ski-ing to be a good, and to them
attractive, exercise, determined to hold similar meetings at
Christiania each winter. The accounts given of those meetings
are very ludicrous, the hill being neither steep nor long, the
competitors riding astride their poles down the track, and only
jumping, if jumping it could be called, a few yards. The
exhibitions did not “catch on,” and were discontinued for many
years. The townsfolk knew too little about the sport to
appreciate it, and the absurd, if not painful, appearance of the
competitors was not encouraging to aspirants. Towards the
end of the seventies, however, owing chiefly to the exertions of
the Christiania Ski Club&mdash;a select institution with but few
members&mdash;some Telemarken peasants<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> were induced to visit the
capital, and in the early part of 1879 a ski meeting was held on
the slopes of the hill at Huseby, near Christiania, which was
attended by a couple of the countrymen, who took part, together
with other competitors, in the races and leaping that had been
arranged. The Huseby slope was one which, only a few years
previously, had been described as highly dangerous, and impossible
to descend when the snow was fast and in good
condition.</p>

<p>The leaping competition proved most highly interesting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
though in some respects quite comical. Every man, except the
Telemarkings, carried a long, stout staff, and on that, so they
thought, their lives depended. Starting from the summit,
riding their poles, as in former times, like witches on broom-sticks,
checking the speed with frantic efforts, they slid downwards
to the dreaded platform or “hop” from which they
were supposed to leap, but over which they but trickled, as it
were, and, landing softly beneath, finally reached the bottom
somehow, thankful for their safe escape from the dreaded slide.
But then came the Telemark boys, erect at starting, pliant, confident,
without anything but a fir branch in their hands, swooping
downwards with ever-increasing impetus until with a bound they
were in the air, and 76ft. of space was cleared ere, with a
resounding smack, their ski touched the slippery slope beneath,
and they shot onwards to the plain, where suddenly they turned,
stopped in a smother of snow dust, and faced the hill they had
just descended! That was a sight worth seeing, and one never
to be forgotten, even if in after years such performances have
been, in a way, totally eclipsed.</p>

<p>This wonderful exhibition of the peasants’ skill naturally
excited the greatest interest, and acted on the townsfolk like a
charm. Their leaping was regarded as one of the wonders of
the world, and in subsequent years people flocked to Christiania
from far and wide to witness it. Then came the turn of the
tide, the eyes of the city youths became opened&mdash;the eyes of
those who, during the long winter days had, for want of better
occupation, frequented billiard-rooms or ill-ventilated cafés,
where the seeds of idleness and vice lay ready to strike root.
By degrees such old haunts became forsaken, for the attractions
of the newly-found sport proved greater than those of the bottle,
and even if they failed to attract and reform the <i>majority</i> of men
just at that period, they certainly had a most beneficial influence
on many, and, as time advanced, on the younger generation,
who were able to take to the pastime before bad customs could
affect their ways. Like other things, especially before its
novelty had worn off, ski-ing was, and often still is, carried to
an excess, but that it is a healthy pastime is a fact beyond all
doubt. To men it came as a boon and a blessing, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
subsequently to women and girls, who, in the short winter days
and close confinement to the house, suffered terribly from
anæmia and all its attendant evils. At the time referred to the
fair sex was debarred by public opinion from participating in
masculine pursuits, and it is not so very long ago that pater and
materfamilias looked askance at girls who donned the ski.
That is all changed now, however, and ski-ing has produced of
later years a race of robust men and healthy women, presenting
the greatest possible contrast to those who lived “in the good
old times,” unconscious of the benefits of exercise and fresh air,
shut up in close and dingy rooms to escape from the dreaded
cold and the touch of an icy blast.</p>

<p>For some years the peasants carried all before them, both in
the racing and leaping competitions. They were steady on
their legs, accustomed to the mountain slopes from their infancy,
and could out-pace and out-distance all competitors. They did
not, however, understand the art of training; the townsmen
soon saw they could not get on without that, and ended at last
in beating their teachers on all points, first in jumping, which
they practised as an art, and, secondly, in racing given distances.</p>

<p>It may be well now to touch upon ski-ing proper, or the
employment of ski for the purpose for which they were originally
intended, viz., travelling over snow-clad land or ice. By
means of these appliances people are enable to roam at will,
enjoying the fresh, crispy air, the pretty landscape, and changing
scenery, combined with the pleasant sensation of gliding,
instead of tramping, over the surface of the country. The speed
attained is certainly not very great, and is about the same in
hilly as on level country, for in the former the time lost in
ascending slopes is made up on the descent. In racing, the time
made by the best men, travelling lightly clad, and under the
best conditions of snow and weather, works out at about eight
and a half miles an hour on a course of a little over nine miles,
and nearly eight miles an hour on one of eighteen and a half
miles. In racing, the longest distance ever run at a stretch was
covered by a Lapp, who, at Jokkmokk, in Sweden, made a good
137 miles in 21 hours and 22 minutes, over comparatively level
ground, thus at a rate of about six and a half miles an hour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
Ordinary travellers, or soldiers on ski, would find five to five
and a half miles an hour quite sufficient to tax their powers. In
1900, a detachment of the Norwegian Guards accomplished a
march of 125 miles in seven and a half days, an average of some
seventeen and a half miles a day, which must be looked upon as
a very good performance, considering that they carried canvas
wherewith to improvise tents, sleeping bags, and provisions, and
moved up hill and down dale, once ascending to a height of
4,000ft. above the sea level. It will thus be seen that, in
marching trim, soldiers on ski do not travel faster, or to any great
extent faster, than infantry at other times, the only advantage
of the ski being that, when the snow lies, they are able to
move about, and get along in parts where men not provided
with such appliances, or snowshoes, would be compelled to
remain idle.</p>

<p>Attention may now be drawn to leaping, which was originally
learned by the Norwegians on the slopes of their hills when
inequalities of ground would, during a rapid descent, cause the
wearer to bound through the air for some distance, possibly only
a yard or two, but sufficient, anyway, to create a longing for a
little more. This led the peasants to make an artificial rise on
the face of a hill, and there meet to see who could leap farthest.
In no other country was the leaping ever attempted, and it is
primarily due to it that ski-ing caught on, and became so
popular in Norway as to throw all other pleasures into the shade,
and attain its present position as <i>the</i> national pastime of the
people. To be understood ski-leaping must be seen. No photograph
or description can ever give a proper idea of it. Many
of those who now appear as the best leapers are men who
devote their chief energies to this branch of the sport, and
who attend all the meetings they possibly can. They might
be called “pot hunters,” but this term can, fortunately, be
hardly applied to them as yet, for the remuneration of a prize
can scarcely repay the expenses they incur in loss of time,
travelling, &amp;c. They, in fact, perform for the love of the
amusement, and, it may be said, nothing else except, possibly,
renown. Ever since the peasants, in 1879, startled the country
by their leaping powers, jumping has steadily improved,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
<i>i.e.</i>, in length, and in the courage or daring of the leapers.
But, while acknowledging this to some extent, it must be
considered doubtful whether the modern wonderful accomplishments
equal or surpass those of the Telemarken peasants, who,
some twenty odd years ago, made bounds of 70ft. and upwards,
with their ordinary country outfit of home-made ski, simply
fastened with toe straps of twisted withes, whereas now men
wear ski specially made for the purpose, strapped securely to
their boots.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to conclude by giving a list of those
who have made the longest leaps, and continued their course
without a spill.</p>

<p>From the above it will be seen that the longest leap recorded
was one of 134½ft., truly a wonderful performance, and one that
could only be accomplished on an exceedingly steep hill by
most able performers.</p>

<p>In penning the above the writer trusts that he has thrown
some light on the origin and history of ski, and the purpose
to which they have been devoted of late years by the Norwegians,
the founders of the sport of ski-ing.

<span class="medium">By <span class="smcap">W. R. Rickmers</span>.</span></h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p>If dates there must be, historians will do well to take
February 8th, 1891, as the day on which the sport of ski-ing
took root outside of Scandinavia. On that day Dr. Pilet, French
Consul at Kolmar, appeared at the Hotel Feldbergerhof, Feldberg,
Black Forest, with a pair of ski, and since then the Black
Forest has been the centre of ski-running in Germany, whence it
has spread to Switzerland, chiefly through the efforts of W.
Paulcke, whose crossing of the Bernese Oberland in the nineties
caused a great sensation and induced many mountaineers to show
an interest in the new sport.</p>

<p>There had been many sporadic efforts before and outside of
Dr. Pilet’s enthusiastic propaganda, but his was destined to bear
fruit before all the others owing to the favourable conditions
under which it started, for the Feldberg is an admirable field
to insure the rapid growth of such a seed. The hotel lies at
a height of over 3,000ft., and has for many years been open
throughout the entire winter, whereas, most other places of a
similar character were formerly shut up and deserted during the
snowy season. Even before the days of ski-ing many lovers of
Nature had visited the mountain to spend a few days above the
mist and slush to which a series of mild winters has now accustomed
the inhabitants of the plains. Add to this the close
proximity of Freiburg, a university town full of young and
energetic men, and we have the explanation why here the first
ski-missionary was so successful. True, St. Moritz had a far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
better chance, but there the first impulse would have been
smothered by the conservative inertia of a fashionable crowd.</p>

<p>In the usual course of events Austria would simply have
followed the lead of Freiburg, and have been content with a very
gradual increase of the ski-running public. But here there
arose a man, Herr Zdarsky, who, single-handed, and through his
untiring personal efforts, furthered the sport by leaps and
bounds. He invented a special ski of his own, commonly known
as the “Lilienfeld” (<a href="#Page_42">p. 42</a>). He taught himself, for he had
never seen a ski-runner, and he elaborated a scientific method of
teaching the various movements and evolutions. He may have
opinions of his own, some of which may have been proved to be
relatively wrong, or have been vetoed by a majority, but the
fact remains that he was the first systematic teacher of ski-running.
To him we owe a published theory of ski-ing as
specially applicable to steep and difficult Alpine ground;
while many, including the writer of these lines, enjoy the honour
of being his disciples. This honour was not, in the first instance,
without its drawbacks, for a theory, especially if it be new and
original, is a fertile source of dissension. The theory would
perhaps have been forgotten, and the “Lilienfeld” fastening
might now be rusting in the patent office, had Herr Zdarsky not
been a man of action endowed with an iron will. Practice
carried the day. Ten years ago there was one pupil at Lilienfeld;
last winter (1905) over 1,200 received instruction from this indefatigable
pioneer, to whose village special trains carry devotees
from Vienna every Sunday.</p>

<p>The differences between the Zdarsky school and the Black
Forest threatened to assume alarming proportions, for, strange
to say, both sides had seen little of each other, and a host of
misunderstandings arose between them over theoretical opinions
concerning style and fastening. Fortunately the storm has now
blown over, for many things have been cleared up, and the old
hands have ceased to bother their heads about the best fastening
or the best method. Thus the “Lilienfeld Strife” is a chapter
of history, an interesting phase in the evolution of our noble
sport. To put the matter in a nutshell, the Black Forest looks
at the question of ski and style exclusively from the Norwegian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
point of view of all-round excellence, whereas Lilienfeld
approaches the subject with the sole idea of quickly teaching the
beginner how to run safely on mountainous ground. Had this
been properly understood at once, there would have been no
quarrelling, for these two standpoints are not antagonistic, but
complementary. The general theoretical truth is the mean
between the two, whereas the absolutely practical method is their
application to the age, physique, talents, and inclinations of
each particular individual intent upon learning to ski.</p>

<p>In Switzerland there has been no less interest shown in ski-ing
than elsewhere, and it is doubtless destined to be the great
ski-ing country of the future, boasting, as it does, of mountains,
snowy valleys, and a thriving population. Norwegians have told
me that, according to their belief, they may some day be surpassed
by the Swiss, who have at their disposal a much greater
choice of long and steep slopes. In Switzerland the natives and
the visitors, as a rule, know very little of each other. The
natives have taken the cue from the Black Forest, whereas the
visitors, mostly English, have exhibited a laudable impartiality
and an enthusiasm which bids fair to raise ski-running to the
first rank among British winter sports.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In the foregoing article Mr. Rickmers has omitted one or two
points in the development of Continental ski-running which may here be
mentioned.</p>

<p>The translation of books treating of polar expeditions, and, in particular,
the eloquent passage about ski in Dr. Nansen’s First Crossing of Greenland,
was largely responsible for the first growth of the sport on the
Continent. History, too, has repeated itself, and Norwegian students
resident in foreign universities and technical schools have played much the
same part in Germany and Switzerland as the early Telemarkings played in
Christiania. We remember well the astonishment and enthusiasm which
was aroused at the meeting of the Glarus Club in 1903, when Messrs.
Heyderdahl and Holte gave an exhibition of leaping and quick turning.
Never had the people seen such a sight before, and the good seed sown
took root, and bore green shoots at once in the shape of numerous little
jumps constructed by the juvenile population. And as in Glarus, so in
other places, people were suddenly awakened by an exhibition of expert
skill to the immense possibilities of the long unwieldy-looking boards.</p>

<p>Great praise is also due to such men as Dr. Paulcke, of Freiburg; Herr
Iselin, of Glarus; Herr Von de Beauclair, of Bern (to mention only three), for
the organisation and conduct of ski clubs in their special districts, and the
holding of race meetings and courses of instruction presided over by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Norwegian experts. Other clubs sprang up in all directions, and a great
number of meetings began to be held in different parts of the country. In
Switzerland, indeed, this soon became a source of inconvenience, for every
little club had its championships which professed to cover a far larger area
than fact warranted. It was accordingly arranged last year (1904) to form a
large central association for all Switzerland, which, in due course, held its
meeting at Glarus on January 21st, 1905.</p>

<p>Even as these lines are going to press the news comes to hand of a
large association of all the clubs of Central Europe, and, although in the
meanwhile no central meeting is contemplated, it seems more than probable
that some arrangement of the sort will, at no very distant period, be found
convenient.</p>

<p>At these Continental gatherings it was last year (1904) decided to observe
the same principles as in Norway, and the chief honours are now awarded
to those competitors who show the greatest skill in both long-distance racing
and jumping. The long-distance race is thus, in the main, a test of speed
and endurance, whilst the jump shows whether a runner is courageous,
quick-witted, and skilful as well as strong.</p>

<p>The use of ski from a military point of view is somewhat outside the scope
of a book of this kind which proposes to deal with them chiefly as instruments
of sport. It is sufficient to say here that the military authorities
of all the principal Continental Powers have given practical recognition of
the value of ski in winter warfare, and it is now usual to hold races
designed specially for soldiers at all ski meetings of importance. In the
opinion of all <i>competent</i> judges, ski would be of great value in the north-west
frontier of India, but up till the present no good ski-runner has been
invited by the Government to put matters to the test. For an interesting
essay on the subject see Mr. H. Chubb’s article in the Ski Club of Great
Britain’s Year-Book, No. 1., Vol. I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h3 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>Ski-running is a sport which literally throws one into a whirl
of excitement from the moment one starts learning it. Thus the
novice who has once tried will not worry over the question as to
how long he will take to master the art. The constant repetition,
however, of the inquiry: “How long does it take to learn
ski-running?” forces us to make some kind of reply, though
unwilling to compromise ourselves by laying down a hard and
fast rule. Given, then, a pair of ski, snow, correct methods,
and a certain amount of patience, anyone gifted with average
pluck and muscle should know enough after a week’s practice
to enjoy excursions of four or five hours’ length. The practice
of the first day or two is always the most trying, but after this
progress becomes rapid. Every beginner falls continually and
expends an enormous amount of energy in getting up again, and
every beginner misapplies the greater part of his strength in
other directions. But an elementary balance is soon gained,
and one quickly learns how to make those little movements of
the thigh muscles which save so much. We are far from saying
that at the end of a week you will be even a moderately good
ski-runner. Downhill your more skilful companions will be able
to leave you far behind, and you will be sorely embarrassed
when the ground is at all difficult. But at the end of that time
you ought to be far enough advanced to enjoy something of the
sensations of a swift descent, and to enter upon the confines of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
that territory of snow-clad forest and mountain which it will be
your special privilege to visit. And that is already much.</p>

<p>Whilst it is our belief that no other form of exercise offers
greater opportunities for the development of individual skill, it
is certain that in no other are the surroundings more beautiful
or more novel. The landscape is, as it were, transfigured, for
the commonest objects become ennobled when swathed in the
flowing garb of the snow-drift, with its sparkle of iridescent hues.
There is a stillness and a clearness and a blueness of the atmosphere,
and a play of golden sunlight through the branches of the
pine trees, standing so erect and silent, sleeping till the return
of spring. And above the trees fresh wonders lie in store. Vast
slopes of snow, broken here and there by some dark rock, and
behind them the soaring watch-towers of the Alps, with their
time-worn battlements and shattered walls. Below, in the gulf
of the valley, lies the village, diminutive like a German toy at
the bottom of a staircase; and on the other side rise whitened
slopes, with clusters of tiny châlets, snow-covered and silent; and
far away in the enchanted distance, clear-cut, yet mystical,
stretches a fairyland of filmy peak and glacier, blending its
opalescence with the blue of heaven. A week is surely a short
apprenticeship to serve for the enjoyment of these wonders, and
we honestly believe that, if you are reasonably strong and diligent,
you can see them at the end of that time.</p>

<p>Like most things, ski-running is best learnt young. A certain
suppleness of limb characterises the style of those who have
begun in childhood, and this, like the true accent of a foreign
language, is most difficult to acquire in after years. Nevertheless,
it is astonishing what can be achieved long after the muscles
have set. In proof of which we may instance that two really
good runners with whom we are acquainted did not begin, in
the one case till after thirty and in the other till after fifty.
We do not, therefore, consider it likely that you are too old to
learn, though we are willing to believe that you may be too
lazy!</p>

<p>An encouraging feature of the sport is the constant improvement
one makes. In many other pursuits a point seems soon
to be reached beyond which further progress is very difficult.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
But with ski-running every season brings its due measure of
advance. A well-known skater is credited with the observation
that anybody could learn to skate, but that to be a first-class
ski-runner one must not only be born on ski, but live on them
constantly for eighty years&mdash;an hyperbole which contains a
strong element of truth. Of course, as in other things,
an early beginning is of great value, but a natural
aptitude can very well be developed late in life. It
is the object of a book of this kind to provide instruction in
those methods which experience has shown to be useful, and we
believe that if the beginner will himself help us by using his
intelligence, he will be very materially assisted by the perusal
of these pages. At the same time, it must not be forgotten that
the best we can hope to do is to place before him a sort of
grammar of the sport. The spoken language, the unconscious
and instantaneous adaptation of the various positions advocated
to the circumstances of the case, can only be acquired by practice
directed by common sense.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h2 id="PART_I">PART I.<br />

<span class="large">THE GROUND AND THE SNOW.</span></h2>

<p>Wherever there is snow, there one <i>can</i> ski; whether one safely
<i>may</i> is another question, whereof more anon. Absence of snow,
or snow transformed into blue ice, are therefore the well-defined
limits to the possibilities of the sport.</p>

<p>There is no kind of surface capable of harbouring snow
which has not been tried on ski, from the plain, with its unbroken
sheet of white, to the rugged mountain side, where
narrow channels have to be navigated amid toothed reefs and
giddy precipices.</p>

<p>Every pedestrian knows the infinite variety there is in landscape;
how an ever-changing aspect of the surface is created by
the geological nature of the soil (sand, moor, rock)&mdash;the vegetation
(grass, heather, forest)&mdash;the inclination of the slopes and
other topographical features (downs, hills, mountains, valleys,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
lakes); not to forget the work of man (his houses, fences, roads,
and ditches). For the ski-runner this great variety of ground
is increased a hundredfold by the different states of the snow,
which he learns to distinguish in the course of his outings. The
changes snow is capable of are wonderful to behold, and the
observant tourist never ceases to discover some kind or condition
which is new to him. There is soft, flaky, fresh-fallen snow;
there is downy, fluffy, powdery, floury, crystalline, brittle, salt-like,
slithery, gelatinous, watery snow; there is snow as hard
and white as marble, and snow with a thick crust which breaks
into big slabs; there can be a layer of soft or powdery stuff on a
hard sheet, or a thin, glassy film over loose snow. We have seen
it in thin scales, the size of half-crowns, rustling under the ski
like the leaves of an autumn forest, or, again, in the form of
long, streaky crystals, like asbestos. Often it lies pat and smooth
over the rounded hills; at other times it will be a frozen turmoil
of waves, ridges, and grooves!</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Variable Ground is Desirable.</span></h5>

<p>In stating that it is possible to ski on every kind of snow and
on every form of snow-covered ground, it is at the same time to
be observed that some kinds of snow and some kinds of ground
are more suitable for the sport than others. And as regards the
ground, most people prefer it to be as varied as possible. We
do not like it to be all precipitous mountain-side or all dead
level, or, for that matter, all undulating glade. Nor do we
desire our slopes to be always smooth and easy, any more than
we wish them always broken and difficult. A happy combination
of all these things is best. We adore the straight, smooth
descent of a long incline, with its wind-song in the ears and its
snow spray in the face, but we have also an affection for turning
hither and thither amongst trees and rocks. And even level
running, which the beginner is apt to despise, is much more
interesting and much more difficult than many people are
inclined to believe.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Snow Should be Uniform.</span></h5>

<p>But, whilst the ground itself should be varied, it is most
desirable that the snow upon it should be of uniform quality
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
throughout. Sudden changes, as, for example, when a thin
crust will bear for some distance and then suddenly give way,
are not only unpleasant, but sometimes positively dangerous.
Perhaps the best of all snow is that which has rested for some
time undisturbed at a temperature a few degrees below freezing
point. Under such favourable conditions the tiny crystals of
which it is composed settle down and pack together, forming a
mass, the compactness of which increases with its depth. Nor
does the surface remain unchanged, for here the dew condenses,
and in freezing forms the innumerable thin leaf-like films above
mentioned. The ski glide very easily over these, and sink into
the compacter substratum just far enough to admit of easy
steering.</p>

<p>Another capital snow condition is when a hard crust has been
formed, on the top of which more snow falls to the depth of a
few inches, the first few flakes of the new fall being wet, so as
to adhere to the old crust and prevent slipping.</p>

<p>Wind-driven snow is not usually very good, but sometimes,
if the temperature be not too low, it will form itself into a
compact floury sort of substance, which will stick slightly to the
ski to a degree just sufficient to help up-hill, but not enough to
cause annoyance or to prevent a free passage downwards. Very
hard snow is bad both for climbing and for glissading, for up-hill
it becomes necessary to stamp vigorously in order to obtain
a footing, and down-hill the lack of side grip renders steering
very difficult. But quite watery snow, especially if it be shallow,
often affords capital sport.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Sticky Snow.</span></h5>

<p>The worst condition possible for ski-running is when, the
temperature being slightly above freezing, the snow “balls.”
This sometimes occurs with old snow when the sun is very hot,
but much more frequently immediately after a fresh fall. The
cause of balling is that water is formed on the surface, which,
being pressed down into the colder substratum, re-freezes, and
adheres to the bottom of the ski: to this, being again wetted,
large clods of the “binding” snow readily attach themselves;
sliding becomes out of the question, and one is obliged at every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
step to lift many pounds’ weight of mingled snow, water, and
ice. Some partial cures for this evil exist, and will be found
at the end of the book at page 105; but they are at the best
but makeshifts, and to our minds ski-running in sticky snow is
never really enjoyable. Fortunately, this state of affairs is not
nearly so common as one might at first imagine, for after the
snow has settled, even if the air be warm, the ski do not usually
sink in sufficiently to reach the cold under-surface, and no re-freezing,
the primary cause of sticking, takes place.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Crusted Snow.</span></h5>

<p>Another kind of bad snow occurs after warm weather followed
by frost, when an ice crust is formed. If sufficiently thick to
bear, and if slightly warm, this is not so bad; but if it bears in
some places and not in others a very irritating, and sometimes
even dangerous, state of affairs exists. The evil is aggravated
when the sun’s rays, penetrating, but not melting, the clear ice
surface, are strong enough to reach the ground below. This
being dark coloured, is warmed, and, of course, melts the snow
which is close to it, forming large hollows, which, though capital
hot-houses for plants, are veritable traps for the unwary ski-runner.
On such a surface, when the crust is strong, the ski
will slide rapidly, but when it is rotten they will break through,
precipitating the runner forward, cutting his face and hands,
and not improbably spraining his limbs and breaking his ski.
Turning on such snow is a matter of extreme difficulty, for
the pressure involved usually breaks the crust, with similar
disastrous results. It behoves us to avoid such places, or, if we
must cross them, to exercise extreme caution in doing so.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Patchy Snow.</span></h5>

<p>A third, but less serious, sort of bad snow is commonly
encountered, when the surface, being for the most part firm and
in good order, becomes interrupted here and there by marble-like
patches of very fine powder. This is a state of affairs which
often occurs high up, when the cold is intense, and when strong
winds blow fine snow over an otherwise good surface. The
powder settles on the lee side of any inequalities and adheres to
any slight irregularities. The ski glide very well over the old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
snow, but are checked by the powder, and a fall forward results.
A little practice, however, soon enables one to distinguish between
the semi-transparent, crystalline, darker-looking, old snow
and the more opaque, white, fresh powder; and one learns how
to make allowances by leaning backwards or forwards.</p>

<h5>“<span class="smcap">Skavler.</span>”</h5>

<p>Another disagreeable variety of snow worthy of special mention
is the frozen turmoil of waves previously mentioned. This,
too, occurs very high up, and is caused by wind. In the Norwegian
tongue it is known by the expressive name of <i>skavler</i>.
The ridges are sometimes as much as a couple of feet high, and,
being quite hard, they are very unpleasant to traverse. They
occur, of course, on the sides of mountains more exposed to the
wind. If one <i>must</i> cross them, a long ski is preferable to a
short ski for the purpose, but there is often a way round if one
looks for it intelligently.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">An Eye for Country.</span></h5>

<p>In this connection it may be said at once that to choose one’s
way correctly and quickly, either up hill or down, is a most
important part of ski-running, demanding just about as much
skill as the preservation of the balance. What is known as <i>an
eye for country</i> seems to be very largely a natural gift. Some
people are always in difficulties, whilst others, often less skilful
in other respects, are able to find their way almost intuitively
across unknown ground. But, of course, experience in this, as
in other matters, counts for a great deal, and what may at first
sight strike the beginner as prophetic inspiration is often nothing
more than an application of previously acquired knowledge to
present conditions. It is impossible to give much information
of this kind in a book, but, nevertheless, a few hints on the
subject may be found useful.</p>

<p>In the first place it may be said that as a general rule snow
is in better running condition on the north sides of hills, which
are shaded from the sun, than on the south, which are exposed
to it. And this is true not only of mountains as a whole, but of
every little hillock and inequality throughout their contour.
Also it is to be observed that the sun is warmer towards the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
middle of the day than in the early morning, but that the
temperature usually falls about a degree Fahrenheit for every
300 feet one ascends. From which considerations it is evident
that it generally pays to climb a mountain on the south side,
where the snow will be firm, and, at all events late in the year,
to start early in the morning. The north side will usually be
the best for the descent, as there the snow will probably be
powdery and manageable.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_024" src="images/i_024.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">In Nordmarken, near Christiania.</span></p>

<p class="copy"><i>Photo by H. Abel.</i></p></div>

<p>Again, the direction of the prevalent winds, as above mentioned,
has considerable influence, and one will as a rule find
the surface harder on the weather than on the lee side of
mountains.</p>

<p>Another thing worth remembering is to proceed very carefully
over stony ground early in the year. If a stone be struck
it will almost certainly damage the ski, and very probably cause
a spill; and in December many stones are concealed by an inch
or two of fluffy snow, which is no adequate protection. By
February, however, the covering will be both deeper and firmer,
and the risk will not be so great. Grass or small heather, on
the other hand, even though half exposed, does not stop the
free passage of the ski, but earth&mdash;as, for instance, that cast up
by a mole&mdash;is almost as bad as stones. So much for the mole-heap.</p>

<p>Let us now pass to the consideration of mountains.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Eternal Snows.</span></h5>

<p>Concerning this kind of ground it is needful to give a word of
serious advice, to sound a note of warning&mdash;that is, about Alpine
ground, the high mountain, and more particularly the region of
the glacier. Winter among the <i>highest</i> Alps taxes to the
utmost the experience and the qualities of the mountaineer.
While affording the intensest excitement and causing a feeling
of the greatest elation when successful, expeditions to these are
never free from grave danger, as is sufficiently demonstrated by
the victims whom ski-mountaineering has already claimed. The
proportion of accidents is really appalling, and should make the
ski-runner pause before venturing unwarily into the region of
<i>eternal</i> snow. To mountaineers we need only say: “Observe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
the rules of your craft with redoubled watchfulness when ski-ing
in the Alps.” Others we must earnestly implore not to undertake
an excursion in the higher regions unless accompanied by
experienced companions or native guides. Good “ski-hills”
recommended for downright enjoyment, and free from conditions
causing undue anxiety, are rarely higher than 8000 feet
(sometimes 10,000 feet); and we strongly advise the beginner to
stick to such and to leave the more ambitious summits severely
alone.</p>

<p>In drawing this danger zone it must not, however, be assumed
that every mountain under the limit is safe. The mountains,
as it were, recede from us in the winter, and many summits and
passes which afford a pleasant stroll in the summer become
fraught with difficulty when the snow queen annexes them for a
time to her dominions. Gracious to those who have been properly
“presented,” and who approach her in a spirit of reverence,
that lady arms herself against the <i>parvenu</i> who would
force his way to her presence and shake her by the hand.
Giddiness, snow-blindness, frost-bites, snow-storms and mists,
steep ice slopes, hidden crevasses, tottering cornices, and last,
but not least, the avalanche, are amongst her weapons. In the
use of these she is quite pitiless, and she usually contrives to
cunningly conceal them and to pounce upon her victim when he
is most off his guard.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Geographical.</span></h5>

<p>The beginner who has followed us so far is probably now
imbued with the idea that ski-running is a most dangerous
sport, and that if he is not overwhelmed by an avalanche, he is
pretty sure to break his leg in some one or other of the kinds of
bad snow which have been mentioned. Let him take heart.
By far the greater part of the snow-covered ground within easy
reach of his abode is sure to be perfectly safe, and, provided
that he is reasonably careful, the chances of an accident are
very small. During the months of January and February the
snow is usually in excellent condition in any of the usual winter
resorts in Norway or on the Continent,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> and by going further
afield very good going may often be found until the end of April.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p>Still, it is quite exceptional to enjoy a day’s expedition without
encountering a little bad or indifferent snow during some part
of it, on which occasions the difference between the beginner and
the expert will be more than ever apparent. The great secret
is to go carefully, but to keep moving. Make up your mind
what you are going to do, and do it. A hill is never anything
like as difficult as it looks from the top, but it is usually considerably
higher than it looks from below. In the clear atmosphere
of such countries as Norway and Switzerland it is very
difficult to judge distances. The moral is to consult maps. In
Switzerland these are specially excellent, but even the very old
and somewhat inaccurate surveys of Norway are far more reliable
than your own or even the natives’ opinion about such matters.</p>

<p>A corollary to the importance of maps is the importance of
the pocket compass, without which no party of ski-runners should
ever venture far from home. It is surprising how easily a mist
or a heavy snow-storm will cause one to lose one’s way, even on
ground with which one is perfectly familiar at other times. In
doubtful weather take a bearing or two as you go along. To do
so takes very little time, and your knowledge <i>may</i> be of great
value on your return journey.</p>

<p>We may conclude this section by directing the reader’s attention
to the Year-Book of the Ski Club of Great Britain, which
contains a great deal of information about ski-running from a
geographical point of view. No. 1 of Vol. I., which has just
been issued, deals with important centres for the sport in Great
Britain, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, &amp;c., &amp;c. The
articles are all written by disinterested and practical men, who
are themselves ski-runners, and the reader could not do better
than turn to it for detailed information concerning any country
which he intends to visit. The book is edited by Mr. E.
Wroughton, and is published for the club by Horace Cox,
Bream’s Buildings, London. It is issued free to members of the
club and for one shilling to the general public.

<span class="large">OUTFIT.</span></h2>

<h4 id="THE_SKI">THE SKI.</h4>

<p>Almost every valley in Norway had at one time its own special
type of ski, supposed by its inhabitants to be peculiarly suited to
their requirements; and in other lands the variations have been
no less numerous and remarkable. Those interested in antiquities
of this kind are recommended to visit Herr Welhaven’s very
large and complete collection in Christiania, which it is to be
hoped the Norwegian nation will acquire and exhibit in a
suitable museum before it is purchased by some wealthy
foreigner. We do not propose to weary the ordinary reader with
a minute description of the various types, especially as time has
shown the special virtues claimed for them to have been largely
imaginary. The very curious Oesterdal ski are, however, worthy
of special notice. In that district the natives used on the left
foot a very long (about 11ft.) and narrow ski, and on the right a
shorter (about 8ft.) and broader one, covered with elk’s or
seal’s skin. The hairy ski was used to push, climb, and turn
on, and was called the <i>Andor</i>; whilst the long one, called the
<i>Langski</i>, was for resting on when running straight. The long
ski was of special value in crossing the hard, lumpy snow so
common in that wind-swept region. There was much sense in
this arrangement, for in point of fact one does as a rule, even
now, run on one ski and steer with the other; but we fancy that
the uneven movements on the level must have been somewhat
fatiguing. Be this as it may, the <i>Andor</i> and the <i>Langski</i> are
now practically extinct, and in hilly countries the <i>Telemark</i> ski
has now superseded all others. In Sweden, Finland, and
Russia, and in flat countries generally, a very long, thin, and
narrow ski is found to be faster. The curve in front is very
flat, and there are considerable variations in the form of groove
used underneath. But for a mountainous country these are too
long for up-hill work, and the sharp, flat point is not suitable for
glissading. The Telemark type can, on the other hand, be used
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
everywhere, and we have no hesitation in recommending it to
our readers.</p>

<p>To the inexperienced eye there is very little difference
between the shape of the ski used by the Telemarkings who first
came to Christiania and those now for sale in that town or on
the Continent. Differences, however, do exist, and some of them
are important; besides which it is unquestionably pleasant to be
the owner of a handsome pair of ski which, in addition to
possessing certain advantages, are always a source of gratification
to oneself and of envy and admiration to one’s friends. We
will accordingly mention all the points of a really good pair,
beginning with the most important.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Wood.</span></h5>

<p>It is, of course, necessary that they should be made of very
well-seasoned wood, but, unless you happen to be a timber
expert, you will have to take your dealer’s word for this. Ash
is the wood most widely used, and the one which we would
recommend the beginner to purchase. Hickory ski are faster
than ash, but they are considerably heavier, and frequently
brittle. Fir ski are cheap, light, and suitable for children, but
it is difficult to get really good wood strong enough for adults;
moreover, they are considerably slower than ash. Walnut is
also said to be excellent, but it is difficult to procure in long
enough and straight enough planks, and it is little used. A
combination of pine and hickory is often employed for racing,
where extreme lightness and speed are of importance, but it is
not as strong as good ash.</p>

<p>Having decided on the wood, see that the grain is as straight
as possible, and that if at any place it runs out its lines when
doing so point downwards towards the heel, and not upwards
towards the toe; otherwise when the ski begins to wear splinters
will be formed, which will stick downwards into the snow and
act as brakes. Beware of very light ash, which is apt to be
brittle; the best is somewhat heavy even when thoroughly dry
and well seasoned. By-and-by, when you have acquired some
skill, you may perhaps like to have a pair of light ski for the
mountains where you intend to go carefully and take no risks,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
and where consequently the chance of a break is considerably
less; but you will appreciate them all the more if you have got
into the way of using a heavier article down below.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Shape.</span></h5>

<p>The bend in front is of importance. It should begin very
gradually at a point about four-fifths of the distance between
the heel end and the tip, and should not be too steep. A rise
of about 5in., measuring from the ground to the bottom of the
tip, is amply sufficient. A good ski should also be fairly
“whippy” about the point, but the elasticity should be distributed
gradually from centre to tip, and should not come
suddenly at one point only. We also like a ski to be broad at
the bend, a shade broader even than the beautiful form shown in
Figs. 4 and 5. The two qualities of gentleness of curve and
breadth at the tip assist a rapid passage <i>on the top</i> of smooth
snow, whilst the elasticity is valuable on lumpy ground, besides
being conducive to lightness. The desirability of elasticity is, we
think, a reason for eschewing the round-upper-sided ski sometimes
sold in Norway. The round upper-side does not, of course,
permit of so much loose snow resting upon it as the flat, but it
makes the front part of the ski very stiff, and consequently
unpleasant to run on, slow, and liable to break.</p>

<p>Besides the bend at the point, there is a long upward curve
throughout the length of the ski, running from heel to entrance.
The object of this is, of course, to prevent any bending in the
opposite direction caused by the weight of the body; it also
serves to provide an agreeable elasticity when one is running on
the level.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Colour.</span></h5>

<p>The colour of the ski is very largely a matter of taste, and in
nine days out of ten is of no practical importance. Every now
and again, however, there will be a time when the sun will beat
fiercely on dark-coloured ski and warm them, causing the snow
to adhere to them top and bottom more readily than to those of
lighter colour, which throw off a greater proportion of the rays.
For which reason we unhesitatingly give our vote for plain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
varnished or white-painted ski. Black-painted ski are, however,
very common in Norway. They look very smart and present a
pleasing contrast to the snow, and they are frequently recommended
for mountain use, for the reason that when the eye is
dazzled by vast expanses of unbroken white they afford a
valuable point of focus, and so act as a preventive to snow-blindness.
We would, however, strongly advise the reader not
to rely too much on this, or sooner or later his eyes will surely
be affected. Smoked goggles, or some such arrangement as that
recommended on page 50, are infinitely preferable to any black
paint. Besides which, plain varnished ski are ever so much
darker than the snow, and one can focus one’s eyes almost
equally well on them. The painting of ski is, on the other hand,
often a cunning device on the part of unscrupulous dealers to
hide defects in the wood&mdash;a fact which may account for their
popularity to a greater extent than the guileless may suppose.</p>

<p>Having, then, given our vote for plain-varnished, flat-topped,
fairly heavy ash ski of Telemark type, with a long, easy, flattish
elastic entrance and a broadish point, it remains for us to consider
how broad they shall be at the middle and how long over
all, and whether they shall or shall not be provided with a groove
underneath them running from end to end. We approach these
questions with a certain degree of diffidence, for, in the first
place, investigations with a view to their answer have not been,
and perhaps cannot be, carried out with much scientific precision,
and, in the second place, they will always remain very
largely matters of personal taste.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Smooth-bottomed and Broad</span> <i>versus</i> <span class="smcap">Grooved and Long</span>.</h5>

<p>Evidently to some extent the length and breadth of a ski
must be proportionate to the weight of the runner, a certain
degree of carrying surface being necessary to obviate sinking.
But, apart from all questions of support, length is of great
importance. In this respect ski resemble ships, for, generally
speaking, the longer they are the faster they go. Area for area
long ski are faster than broad. On the other hand, the shorter
a ski is the more readily it will turn, and it is, of course, very
important to be able to steer easily. There comes a point, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
when ease of turning develops into wobbling, and seriously
interferes with one’s balance when running straight. Nor is
the unsteadiness of short and broad ski confined to what may be
considered as <i>horizontal</i> wobbling, due to inequalities of the
ground, but broad ski are also more subject to what may be
regarded as <i>vertical</i> wobbling, due to unequal snow consistency.
For in the case of the long ski variations in the carrying power
of the snow and consequent errors of balance occur in a
backward and forward direction, but in the case of a broad ski
in a sideward direction, which latter is, of course, more
upsetting.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_032" src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Gates of the Jotunheim.</span></p>

<p class="copy"><i>Photo by E. C. Richardson</i></p></div>

<p>Again, almost all ski are nowadays provided with a groove
along the bottom, beginning at a point a little distance below
the bend and continuing to the heel. The object of this is to
prevent <i>horizontal</i> wobbling and to assist straight running.
Its working is most powerful. Clearly, then, some sort of compromise
must be arrived at between a very smooth and broad
ski on the one hand, and a very long and grooved one on the
other. Now in Norway straight running is all the order of the
day. Around Christiania there is scarcely a hill which cannot
be, and is not, taken at full speed, and the smooth, glacier
polished mountains of that country are equally suitable for a
straight descent. In the Black Forest, too, straight running is
paramount. For these countries we recommend grooved ski about
as long as the distance between the ground and the roots of the
fingers when the hand is held above the head, and of a width
proportionate to the weight of the runner. In Switzerland,
however, the ground is both steeper and more irregular, and in
general far more difficult for straight running, hidden water-courses,
rocks, and other obstacles being of common occurrence.
There, it is accordingly of paramount importance to the beginner
to be able to control his speed and to turn, and our advice is
that in that country he should, for ordinary going, use somewhat
shorter and slightly broader ski&mdash;say, about 6in. shorter
than in Norway. We advise him <i>for all-round purposes</i> in
Switzerland to retain the groove. But if he is going to do much
climbing on very steep and difficult ground, or if he is advancing
in years and has lost something of his pristine dash, he may find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
it convenient to omit the groove and to travel on perfectly
smooth boards.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Long Alpine Tours.</span></h5>

<p>For really long and arduous mountain tours in the Alps, where
every ounce of weight tells, we would recommend a further
reduction of about a foot in all from the customary Norwegian
length, and only a slight increase (if, indeed, any) in the ordinary
breadth. On such expeditions careful going and power of control
are of paramount importance, and ski-running becomes more
of a means to an end than an end in itself. A little extra sinking
in up-hill is not of much moment, and is more than equalised
by the gain in lightness; and down-hill the loss in speed is of
no consequence&mdash;indeed, in some cases a positive advantage.
On such ski, too, the groove is better omitted.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Preservation.</span></h5>

<p>Ski should be treated properly if they are to retain their full
efficiency. It is a capital plan to oil them from time to time
like a cricket bat. Linseed oil is best for the purpose, and a
small quantity of paraffin should be added to it to help it to
penetrate. This treatment hardens the wood, and renders it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
waterproof and not liable to splinter. Ski should be kept in a
cool place, but should they be taken out of a warm room they
should be left standing in the cold air for about ten minutes
before they are allowed to touch the snow. One should avoid
walking on them over earth and stones. After use they should
be cleaned. To “set” them, place their under sides in contact,
and strap them loosely together at the points where they touch&mdash;viz.,
extreme heel end and base of the tip. Insert a piece of
wood about 2in. square and ½in. thick at a spot indicated by the
usual position of your boot-heel; then strap tightly. They will
then be in close touch at the ends, 2in. apart under the heel,
and the “feathering” is thus preserved.</p>

<h4 id="THE_BINDING">THE BINDING.</h4>

<p>No part of a beginner’s outfit is likely to cause him so much
“sweet sorrow” as his binding. The chances are enormous that
whatever he buys will afford him plenty to think about, and,
alas! to talk about, for a considerable time to come. During his
early efforts he is certain to attribute most of his misfortunes to
its manifest imperfections, and if, as we hope, he is a person of
an inventive turn of mind, he will spend the greater part of his
evenings, and perhaps even some of the watches of the night, in
designing something new and original which will at one and the
same time overcome all his difficulties and make his fortune.</p>

<p>It is our sincere desire to assist him in this laudable endeavour,
and accordingly we shall give below a few of the qualities
which a perfect binding ought to possess. Before proceeding to
do so it will, however, be necessary to notice some of those actual
forms which other ski-runners use or have used&mdash;a task which
is not nearly so agreeable or so easy. For legion is their name,
and it is difficult to make a selection without hurting somebody’s
feelings. During the early days of the sport in Central Europe
(that is to say, till quite recently) the fiercest controversy raged
about bindings (<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>). But now, partly because of the
impossibility of saying anything new on the subject, and partly
because the discovery has been made that after all one’s fastening
is not of paramount importance, the topic is no longer of
absorbing interest. Not but what our Teutonic friends retain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
their love of controversy, and their earnest methods of conducting
such, but the Scotchman in search of an argument would do
better to start some theme other than bindings, as, for example,
seal’s skin or wax. A reaction has, in fact, set in, and whereas
two years ago the most complicated was the best, we were surprised
last season to find a Continental friend using the old
(and very excellent) Lapp binding, which was so much in vogue
in Norway years ago when we first learnt to go on ski. He, of
course, was under the impression that he had the very latest
thing, and we did not enlighten him, but we should not be much
astonished to find him next year twisting birch twigs after the
manner of the early Telemarkings!</p>

<p>Now this plan of making a stiff and strong rope by twisting
birch twigs was the earliest method of connecting the
<i>heel</i> of the foot with the ski. Prior to that a strap
across the toe was all that was used. Any other
arrangement was considered dangerous. Then came the
Telemarkings (<a href="#Page_9">p. 9</a>) with their new methods. They
bound the ski firmly to the toe, and lead ropes of twisted birch
from the toe round the back of the heel. This arrangement was
at once felt to be an advantage. Not only did it prevent the
foot continually slipping out of the toe strap, but it relieved the
toe itself from much of the strain involved when the ski has to
be pulled forward in walking on the level or up hill; moreover,
it enormously helped steering, and so it was adopted.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Some Common Fastenings.</span></h5>

<p>People living in towns, however, either could not procure
birch twigs or lacked skill in preparing and fixing ropes made
from them. Something else had to be substituted, and that
something was the thin cane, which so long held the field. The
canes were steamed, and bent round the back of the heel and
secured in front by a clamp. This form of binding was and still
is widely used. But the canes, even when covered with leather
and strengthened with steel wire, were found to be inconvenient.
They broke and they were cumbersome, and the guiding power
they allowed of was limited. So taboo was broken and metal
was admitted into the construction of the fastening. Contrary,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
however, to expectation, people’s legs did not break oftener than
before, and, as the iron also stood the strain, a binding like that
given below (<a href="#fig006">Fig 6</a>) became very popular.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig006" src="images/fig006.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Lapp Binding, Huitfeldt’s pattern (left foot).</p>

<p class="small">The heel is secured by means of a single thong about 7ft. long, with a loop at
the end. The loop end is doubled close to the loop, and the bight passed
through the hole in the ski below the ball of the foot. The long end is then
passed round the back of the heel, through the bight, back round the heel, and
through the hoop thus:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_037" src="images/i_037.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="small">The whole is then pulled tight, and the long end passed over the instep,
under the thongs on the inside of the foot, back over the instep, and under and
round the thongs on the outside, where it is secured by a couple of half-hitches.
The loose end is then tucked away, as shown in <a href="#fig006">Fig. 6</a>.</p></div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lapp Binding</span> shown above is Huitfeldt’s pattern. The
novelty about it was the iron toe piece; the thong arrangement
had long been used by the Lapps. As previously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
mentioned, many people still employ this binding, and when skilfully
adjusted it can be very firm, and it possesses the merits of
extreme simplicity and ease of repair.</p>

<p>We have, however, several objections to it. In the first place,
it takes some little practice and some little strength to fix the
thong properly, an operation rendered doubly difficult when the
leather is frozen and the fingers cold. Again, the thong,
especially if changes of temperature occur, is continually expanding
and contracting; the knots in it are apt to make sore
places on the foot, and, like a boot-lace, it has an irritating way
of breaking just when one is in a hurry. Again, the iron toe
piece must be <i>most carefully</i> adjusted to fit the boot. In
short, we dislike the whole fastening for the reason that, unless
it is very carefully put on and attended to, it becomes altogether
toe wobbly.</p>

<img id="fig007" src="images/fig007.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;Huitfeldt Binding. Iron Toepiece and Straps.</p></div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Huitfeldt Binding</span> given above is considered by many
people to be an improvement on the Lapp binding, and it has
attained a vast popularity in Norway. In principle it differs
from the latter but little; but very stout straps are substituted
for the thong with its troublesome knots, and the iron toe-piece
is made of a solid piece of metal, which is bent up on either
side of the ski, and which can be hammered into the exact
shape of the sole of the boot. This is an advantage, as an
accurate fit is insured. The disadvantage is that it is liable to
be bent out of shape by the heavy-soled boot which it is
necessary to wear with this and with the Lapp-binding. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
straps, with it too, expand and contract with the temperature,
and a very slight degree of slackness is sufficient to make the
whole very loose. Moreover, the side straps catch the snow to
some extent and act as a brake, though usually this is not of
much consequence. The Huitfeldt binding is also troublesome to
put on firmly, especially when the straps are frozen. Höyer-Ellefsen’s
shortening clamp (<a href="#fig008">Fig 8</a>) is designed to get over this
difficulty, but it is new, and we have not had sufficient experience
of it to offer any criticism.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig008" src="images/fig008.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Höyer-Ellefsen’s Patent Clamp for use with Huitfeldt’s binding.</p></div>

<p>We now come to a new class of fastening, where the heel is
connected with the ski by means of some sort of sole, generally
made of the “belting” used for driving machinery, fixed to the
top of the ski in front of the toe. There are innumerable
variations of this plan, a very simple one being to fix a piece of
the belting in front of the foot and to attach it to the heel of
the boot by means of a dummy heel and a strap leading round
the instep. The toe is held in position either by side irons and
a strap, as in the Huitfeldt binding, or by a simple broad strap
passing through the ski and buckling across the toe. In the
latter form it has attained to considerable popularity on the
Continent, especially in the Black Forest. We do not, however,
think it worth while to give a picture of this fastening, as it is
not one which we can recommend for any purpose. The dummy
heel fills up with snow, and becomes uncomfortable; and as to
the belting, one is in this dilemma, that if one uses it thin it
buckles and if one uses it very thick it becomes heavy and too
stiff for comfortable walking unless it be fastened very far
forward, in which case it rises off the ski at every step and
presses the toe against the toe strap, thereby causing discomfort
and cold feet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Torgersen’s “Handry” Binding</span> (<a href="#fig009">Fig. 9</a>) is, we think, vastly
preferable, for it has no heel to collect snow, and the belting,
only reaching half-way down the foot, is not so liable to buckle.</p>

<p>It cannot, however, claim to be a really firm binding, though
if the strap leading from the belting round the instep be pulled
tight (and a tight strap at this part of the foot does not seem to
affect the circulation) it is not so loose as might be supposed at
first sight. But the chief advantage of Torgersen’s binding is
its extreme adjustability. It will fit almost anybody, and can
be taken on and off in a moment. On this account it is a very
good binding for clubs or shopmen in Switzerland who let out
ski to a number of different people for short periods. Its only
moderate firmness also recommends it to nervous beginners who
want to run straight and fast, and who are afraid of the slight
extra risk involved by using a rigid fastening.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig009" src="images/fig009.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;Torgersen’s Handy Binding. Driving Belt and Straps.
Half the sole is Driving Belt.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ellefsen’s Patent Binding</span> (<a href="#fig010">Fig. 10</a>) is of the same class.
It appeared last season (1904-5), and has scarcely been in use
long enough to allow of exhaustive criticism.</p>

<p>As with Torgersen’s, the belting only reaches about half-way
down the foot, where it is terminated by an iron cross-piece with
upright cheeks fitting on either side of the heel (see <a href="#fig010">Fig. 10</a>).
From these cheeks a strap leads round the back of the heel, by
means of which the belting is pulled tight. This stretching of
the belting is the novelty of the arrangement, and is very
ingenious, as, of course, it prevents all buckling. The iron toe-pieces
are much the same as in Huitfeld, but they are fixed
firmly to the ski by means of the little metal tongues which
are part of them. The tongues at the same time secure the
driving belt under the toe, giving it due stiffness in a vertical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
direction and preventing pressure of the toe strap. But
obviously this is the weak spot of the front part of the
arrangement, and unless the belting is of the very best quality
it is liable to tear there. The makers, however, claim that the
best belting will not tear, and time alone can decide whether
this is so or not. The binding is not readily adjustable, and
when ordering it is necessary to send a sketch of the boot which
one intends to use with it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig010" src="images/fig010.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Ellefsen’s Patent Binding.</p>

<p>The figure with the boot also shows a little strap sewn on to the heel of
the boot to prevent the heel straps slipping off. This is very useful with all the
above-named fastenings. See <i>infra</i>, pp. 47 and 48.</p></div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lilienfeld Binding</span> has caused more discussion and
provoked more criticism than any other. It, too, is on the
“sole” principle, but differs from all others in this respect, that
(except for the heel and toe straps) it is made entirely of metal.</p>

<p>The vertical axis of the sole is, moreover, placed <i>in front</i> of
the toe, and not under it as in other fastenings, and vertical
stiffness is secured by means of a very ingenious spring arrangement
embedded in the ski. This shifting of the axis forward
makes the binding feel curious at first, but one gets accustomed
to it after a while, and then it becomes very comfortable and
pleasant. An objection to the plan is, however, that one is
deprived of much control over the heel of the ski, and is placed,
so to speak, at the mercy of the spring. It is, however, often
convenient to raise the heel of the ski when going up hill, and
it is annoying to find when one tries to do so that it refuses to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
obey on account of the spring being insufficiently screwed up.
On the other hand, if the spring be tight the heel keeps
“clappering” up and down at every step. Another decidedly
bad point about this fastening is its weight. It is unquestionably
heavy. It is necessary, therefore, to use a considerably
lighter ski with it than with any of the ordinary arrangements,
and light ski are apt to be brittle. It is, however, a very
powerful binding, very suitable for making “S” turns on steep
and difficult ground. It seldom or never breaks, and it is
adjustable to almost any boot. It is usually sold fitted to a
special ski with a hole in it cut for the spring. The so-called
“Alpine skee” is shortish, broadish, and flat-bottomed, with a
sharply turned-up bluff entrance. These qualities render it less
suitable for straight running, but useful for turning on the
mountain-side, for which special purpose it is, indeed, designed.
People somewhat advanced in years will find the “Alpine skee,”
with its special fastening, of value for mountain tours, and it is,
we think, easier to learn to turn on it than on any other; but
your dashing youth and your jumper will certainly prefer the
Norwegian article. Of course, the Lilienfeld fastening can be
fixed to a Telemark ski.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Method of Fixing.</span></h5>

<p>The right way of attaching all the above-named bindings to
the boot will have been evident from the descriptions appended
to each. It is sufficient to observe here that the straps (and
particularly the toe-straps) should never be pulled tighter than
occasion demands. Tight straps are the surest road to frost-bite,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
besides being very uncomfortable. For all ordinary going&mdash;that
is to say, during far the greater length of time that the ski are
on the feet&mdash;the straps may be worn comparatively loose. It is
quite easy to tighten them up for a difficult piece of ground or a
jump, and there is no occasion to run unnecessary risks.</p>

<p>Another important matter is that with all ordinary bindings
care should be taken not to thrust the foot too far into the toe-strap.
The toe-strap should never cross the foot lower than the
middle of the great toe. People are apt to neglect this simple
precaution, but in doing so they run the risk of spraining the
foot in the event of a fall forwards. In the case of the Lilienfeld
binding, it is not necessary to be quite so careful, as with it
the vertical axis is in front of the foot.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></h5>

<p>The beginner who has read the above remarks probably
realises by now that <i>there is no such thing as a perfect ski
binding which will satisfy everybody</i>! Some people want
extreme lateral rigidity, others a little play, and others, again,
comparative looseness. It is much the same with the vertical
movement; if very stiff there is great control, valuable for
jumping and for lifting the heel in steep hill climbing,
but the ski “clappers” on the level. If very loose,
the toe has to carry too much weight,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and the advantages
of stiffness vanish. There can really be no such thing as a happy
mean in these matters, and everybody must choose that which
on the whole is best suited to his requirements. Nor can any
form of fastening last for ever, and the most that one can
expect is that a binding should not be continually giving way.
Do not, therefore, begin by worrying yourself too much about
this part of your equipment. Buy one or other of the
bindings depicted above which you think will suit you best,
and learn all about its little peculiarities and something
about ski-running before you decide that it is no good. Above
all things, avoid boring your more experienced friends with
binding talk, of which they have all had enough and to spare.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<h4 id="FOOT_PLATES">FOOT-PLATES.</h4>

<p>In order to protect the ski and to prevent snow adhering to it
under the foot it is necessary to fix some sort of anti-sticking
material to that part which is touched by the boot; and a thin
plate of some non-corrosive metal is best for this purpose; the
india-rubber or seal’s skin commonly sold are of little use, and
soon wear out.</p>

<h4 id="THE_STICK">THE STICK.</h4>

<p>The stick is a good servant, but a bad master. It is little
used by first-class runners, except to enable them to increase the
speed by punting. There can, however, be no doubt that it
greatly assists a beginner in preserving his balance on difficult
ground and in turning. On the other hand, it is equally certain
that it is frequently the cause of his adopting a bad style, of
spoiling his balance, and of hindering or entirely blocking his
progress in the art of turning. To jump with a stick in the hand
is most dangerous, and, of course, there is always the possibility
of the stick being lost or broken on tour.</p>

<p>Accordingly there are those who recommend the beginner to
leave this part of his outfit at home; and much is to be said in
favour of such advice, especially in the case of a young and
active pupil. When, however, it is argued that anybody who
can go on ski without a stick will not have any difficulty in
subsequently taking to one, we venture to differ. Perhaps in
rare cases it may be so, but we have had a somewhat extensive
experience of beginners of all ages, and we have always found it
otherwise. The novice who has learnt without a stick seems to
be greatly embarrassed when one is first placed in his hand.
Moreover, we have met not a few ski-runners, no longer novices,
who make very pretty Telemark and Christiania swings on the
practice ground with hands free, but who break down hopelessly
on tour when encumbered with a stick. But everybody is agreed
that a stick of some sort or other should be taken on tour, and
we fail to see the use of these pretty manœuvres if they cannot
be accomplished when really most required. This, however, is
far from being the whole case for the pole. What is your poor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
elderly friend to do when he tumbles in deep snow? It frequently
requires considerable activity to get up under such
circumstances, and what is here mentioned half in jest might
really be an ugly matter. Besides, nobody over twenty-five can
be expected to enjoy continual struggling head downwards.
People get exhausted, people begin to think that it is impossible
to learn, and people take to some inferior sport which they find
easier, and therefore more amusing. Did you mutter “Let them
go”? Nay; but there we touch the very root of the matter. Is
ski-running merely a pretty form of athletics for the few, or is it a
noble sport for the people, leading them forth from stuffy houses
and narrow roads to the glories of the winter landscape? Surely
the latter; and we would rather the runner sat on his pole at
every hill and visited the woods and mountains than that he was
the cleverest performer on the practice ground and went nowhere
else. “But,” it is said, “if the beginner accustoms himself to
run with a stick in his hand he will be quite helpless when he
loses it or breaks it, or when he wishes to jump.” This is, of
course, to some extent true, but the case is not so bad as all that.
In reality, as above hinted, it is a good deal easier to run without
a stick than with one after a certain stage has been reached; our
experience is that the more advanced pupil soon learns to
appreciate this, and that the transition from stick to no stick is
seldom difficult. Besides, there is no reason to carry matters to
extremes and <i>never</i> to practise with the arms free.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_044" src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Thorwald Hansen.</span> King’s Prizeman, Norway, ’05.</p>

<p class="copy"><i>Photo by Th. Thorkelsen.</i></p></div>

<p>Our advice, then, is:&mdash;<i>Begin by carrying a stick in the hand,
but use it only to overcome a difficulty. Endeavour to be as
independent of it as possible, and practise sometimes without it.</i></p>

<p>Shall the ski-runner use two sticks or one? and shall it or
they be furnished with a basket arrangement at the end (see
Fig. 12)? These are questions which have also been much discussed,
and frequently rather unprofitably. We think that it
all depends on circumstances. Two light bamboos with wicker-work
discs (Norwegian <i>Trindser</i>) at the end are very serviceable
when one has got beyond the beginner’s stage. They help one up
hill and along the level, and down hill they may be trailed
behind in each hand, or on difficult ground held together and
used as one. The discs are, of course, intended to prevent the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
point penetrating the snow to too great a depth&mdash;<i>not</i> to act as
brakes. But on very steep and hard mountain sides where one
may find oneself&mdash;sometimes with a precipice below&mdash;they are
far from being a source of comfort. On such occasions one prefers
to have a single stout staff, which one can thrust deeply
into the snow, and which one knows will not slip or break. And
in general we have not found two sticks to be of much service in
the high Alps, though for lower excursions in Switzerland and
in the Black Forest and everywhere in Norway we prefer them.
The novice, however, should, we think, <i>begin</i> with a simple staff
of good ash or other strong wood, without any disc at the
end. He is sure to require to use his stick to some extent
(indeed, we shall advise him lower down to do so), and he
would probably only break light double sticks. He should
get into the habit of holding his stick in either hand, and
should begin to practise with two as soon as he thinks he is
far enough advanced to do so. In choosing his stick he will
select one about as long as from the ground to the top of his
shoulder. It should be furnished with a metal ferrule and a
spike at the lower end, and a <i>broad</i> leather loop at the top for
the hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig012" src="images/fig012.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Disc for bottom of ski stick, attached by metal ears. Staub
of Zürich’s pattern.</p></div>

<p>The double bamboo sticks should also be about as long as from
the ground to the shoulder. They are best out from the root
end of the plant, where it is strongest; the root also serves as a
convenient lump for the hand to hold. The discs are best
attached by a metal arrangement, as shown in <a href="#fig012">Fig. 12</a>, and not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
by boring a hole in the cane and passing a piece of leather
through it, as is common in Norway. The one method holds for
a long time; the other breaks very soon.</p>

<h4 id="FOOTGEAR">FOOTGEAR.</h4>

<p>This is a very important part of a ski-runner’s outfit, and too
much attention cannot be paid to it. Nevertheless, nothing is
commoner in Switzerland than to see the early efforts of
beginners enormously handicapped by unsuitable boots. English
ladies, particularly, seem to find it difficult to make up their
minds to spend the necessary amount of money on a suitable pair,
and usually appear in thin, high-heeled shoes covered by
“gouties.” But the acme of thoughtlessness was in our experience
achieved by a man who went out in patent-leather boots and
openwork silk socks! The consequences were, of course, frost-bite,
and he narrowly escaped losing a few toes.</p>

<p>A strongly made, waterproof, low-heeled boot is a necessity,
and with most modern bindings the sole should be not less than
half an inch thick. It should be roomy enough to permit of
<i>at least</i> three pairs of extra thick socks being worn, and there
should be plenty of room for the toes to “waggle.” With bindings
such as Huitfeldt’s it is better not to have the toe cut too
square, for a more or less wedge-shaped end fits better into the
toe-irons. In order to resist the pressure of the toe-strap it is
best to have the leather extra thick in front. The boot should
fit fairly tightly round the ankle and instep, for reasonable firmness
at this point does not interfere with the circulation, and is
of value in preventing sprained ankles and chafed heels. With
Ellefsen’s binding, where there are no straps across that part of
the foot, this is of special importance. Nothing is gained by
wearing a sloppy sort of boot and subsequently imprisoning the
foot in tight and narrow straps. The strain of moving the ski
has to be borne somewhere, and it is best to distribute it evenly
where it is least felt. In order to prevent the heel straps
slipping down it is strongly advisable with all the bindings mentioned
above (except the Lilienfeld) to have a small strong strap
and buckle sewn to the heel of the boots. The buckle should
point upwards, and should be fixed quite close. The end of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
strap then points downwards, and is useful as a sort of shoehorn
for pulling on the binding.</p>

<p>For Switzerland we would advise the addition of a <i>few</i> nails
to the sole of the boot. They prevent any slipping about on icy
places round the house, and they make all the difference to one’s
happiness in climbing on foot over a pass, or the last few yards of
some rocky and icy summit. They are not, however, to be recommended
in Norway, where nobody wears them. Not but what
there is plenty of ice round the hotels and sanatoria there, but
in that country custom is everything, and it is better to bear
with a bump or two than to offend.</p>

<p>In the Black Forest ski boots are often made of dog or calf
skin, with the hair left on <i>outside</i>. An inner coating of hair is
often added, but this we think is a mistake, as it is difficult to
dry after use. The exterior coating of hair is, however, a great
protection against cold. It wears out in course of time, and then
the thing to do is to follow the classical example of the King of
the Jews and buy another pair.</p>

<p>Arctic explorers and others who go to very cold places are
unanimous as to the virtues of outside hair, and various devices
exist to enable the runner to fix a covering of it over his
ordinary boots. These inventions are, however, apt to be too
bulky, or to fill up with snow, or to be cut by a nailed boot, and
we cannot recommend any we have seen. A very simple plan
is, however, to nail a piece of skin (or canvas-covered felt) to the
ski in front of the foot, and to pass it between the toe-strap and
the boot. It should be wide enough and long enough to cover
the toes, but not, of course, so wide as to project and act as a
brake. This little dodge helps to keep the toes warm, not only
by the extra covering which it affords, but also by distributing
the pressure of the toe-strap over a greater surface; it also to
some extent prevents snow collecting under the toes and forming
an uncomfortable lump there.</p>

<p>Boots should be greased now and again, but in moderation,
for excessive greasing is said to cause cold feet. The boots
should be warmed (with hot water or otherwise) before the
grease is applied. Castor oil is excellent for this purpose.</p>

<p>The best kind of socks to wear are very thick ones made of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
goat’s hair; but nowadays they are difficult to get. In Norway
so-called “Ragge Sokker” are no longer made of pure material,
and the modern imitation is harsh and uncomfortable. Thick
woollen socks known as “Ladder” are now largely used, and a
pair of these over a good ordinary sock are sufficient for most
purposes. It is, however, always advisable to take a dry pair
in one’s rucksack, for, however waterproof one’s boots may
be, a considerable amount of moisture always accumulates inside
them. This is due to the condensation of perspiration against
the cold outer surface of the boot, and is most dangerous in very
cold weather, when the leather freezes and its pores are choked
by ice. When this occurs the toe-straps should be loosed and
the toes should be kept moving. Frost-bite is very insidious, and
is frequently quite unnoticed by the sufferer till he reaches home
and it is too late. The consequences may be very serious, and it
is impossible to be too much on one’s guard.</p>

<p>From the above it will be seen that there is plenty of room
for improvement in the ski-runner’s footgear. We recommend a
thick under-sock, a pair of good “Ladder,” a stout boot, fitting
well about the ankle, but with plenty of room at the toes, and a
piece of skin covering the toes and held in position by the toe
strap. But, all the same, we frequently suffer from cold feet,
and we wish somebody would invent something better.</p>

<h4 id="OTHER_CLOTHES">OTHER CLOTHES.</h4>

<p>Other clothes are of minor importance. Remember that
the season and the snow are cold, that the latter melts, that
the exercise is at times very violent, and then you are not likely
to try wading trousers or an umbrella. The best clothes for
ski-runners are, perhaps, knickerbockers and a double-breasted
jacket. Choose a material of smooth texture, for woolly stuffs
catch the snow, which soon forms into icy lumps, betraying the
novice and melting unpleasantly in a warm room. All openings
at the neck, sleeves, knees, and ankles must have an arrangement
to fit closely to keep out the snow, which is apt to find
its way in, especially in the earlier stages of practice. Let the
cap, or soft felt hat, be provided with flaps, to protect the ears
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
in a sharp breeze. The so-called St. Moritz cap is excellently
adapted to the purpose. Thick woollen gloves, long enough to
reach high above the wrist, are indispensable, and a second pair
ought to be in the pocket as a change, for wet gloves in a cold
wind are the surest road to frost-bite. Puttees are probably the
best means to shut the top of the boot and to cover the stockings.
Some sort of wind-jacket is necessary in the Norwegian
mountains and elsewhere where strong winds prevail. A capital
one is in use in Austria. It is made of very thin oil-silk in the
form of a sort of smock-frock, with a hood at the back for the
head. It weighs almost nothing, and is warmer than any
sweater. With this and a pair of trousers of the same material
one may laugh at the most biting wind that ever blew, and the
dangers of a night out become greatly minimised.</p>

<h4 id="ACCESSORIES">ACCESSORIES.</h4>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Rücksack</span>&mdash;Norwegian Rypesæk&mdash;came originally from
the Tyrol, and is by far the best means of carrying things. It
should be made of stout waterproof canvas, and should be provided
with broad shoulder-straps. We advise the novice to buy
as good a one as he can afford; he will find it useful for other
things besides ski-running.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smoked Glasses</span>, or some such device as that recommended
below, will generally have to be worn above the tree-line to
protect the eyes from snow-blindness. The precise nature of
this complaint does not appear to be understood. It appears to
be more prevalent in some countries than in others, and is not,
we think, entirely a matter of intensity of light. It seems, for
example, to be more dangerous in the Norwegian mountains
than in Switzerland. Like frost-bite, it is insidious, and the
patient frequently is not seriously inconvenienced till after the
damage is done. Some people, too, are far more susceptible
to it than others. Instead of smoked glass, which is liable to
become dimmed by the condensation upon it of moisture, we
prefer a simple oblong piece of leather, 6in. long and about 1in.
broad, with two oval-shaped holes in it opposite the eyes, say,
½in. long by ⅜in. broad; a slit for the nose to hold it in position,
and two pieces of string to bind it round the head.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">In Derbyshire, November, ’04.</span></p>

<p class="copy"><i>Photo by C. R. Wingfield.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p></div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Water-bottle</span> should be of sufficient capacity; one to
hold about a litre is convenient. It should be provided with a
felt covering and a tight-fitting cork. What to put into it is a
matter of choice, though much alcohol is not to be recommended.
Personally we have given up compounding drinks of cold tea,
sugar, and wine, for the reason that they are so nice that we
drink more at a time than we should. Our companions, too,
look at us with such longing eyes that it is difficult to resist
their dumb appeal. Such a water-bottle is soon empty. Plain
sugar and water is not so nice, but is very sustaining, the sugar
being very rapidly digested, and a raw egg or two adds to the
value of the compound. Dried prunes, acidulated drops, and
other sweetmeats will be found very pleasant on a ski tour, even
though one never touches them at other times. Louis Stevenson
has observed that the hungrier a man is the more he appreciates
delicacies, so do not let your luncheon consist entirely of plain
beef sandwiches. Remember, too, that it is better to eat little
and often than largely and all at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some sort of Repairing Outfit</span> and a spare ski tip should
always be taken with one. There are little light metal tips on the
market made to fit over a broken ski which are very useful. The
kind that fixes with a screw is best, as the other is apt to come
off. If, however, one has the latter, a small screw-nail through
it would keep it in place. With one of these tips, and the means
of making an improvised binding with a few screw eyes and
nails, a washer or two, and some straps, the runner should be
able to get home easily enough wherever his ski may break. The
reader must use his ingenuity in such matters, remembering
always that it is impossible to execute very elaborate repairs
with cold fingers.</p>

<p>There are other odds and ends more or less useful on tour, a
description of which will be found in any dealer’s list.

<span class="medium">TECHNICAL.</span></h3>

<hr class="short" />

<h4 id="PRELIMINARY_ADVICE">PRELIMINARY ADVICE.</h4>

<p>We would very strongly recommend the beginner to make his
first efforts on some one or other of the good snow conditions
described on pp. 21 and 22. Freshly fallen deep snow is
especially to be avoided, for not only does it afford heavy and
difficult going, but a fall in it is apt to be dangerous. This is,
of course, the reverse of what one would expect; but what
happens is that the ski sink in deeply, and in the event of a
fall they are apt to stick and sprain the ankle or knee. The
firmer the snow the better it is, provided always that it be of
sufficient depth and that it be fair snow, and not ice-crust.</p>

<p>All things considered, we would advise the beginner to learn
to go slowly before he learns to go fast. That is to say, as soon
as he can run straight fairly well, we would have him learn
how to regulate his speed and steer by means of what is known
as “stemming” (see <i>infra</i>, p. 69). In practising this movement
he will at the same time learn how to balance himself with the
weight on one foot, a necessary accomplishment; for, though in
ski-running both ski are usually kept on the ground, <i>the weight
is nearly always mainly on one foot</i>. It is well to pause and try
to appreciate this very important fact before reading further.</p>

<p>After he has learnt something of stemming, and provided
that he has followed our instructions and used his pole as little
as possible (and then only as we direct), he should not find much
difficulty in acquiring some speed in glissading. He should then
begin to take short tours of, say, an hour or two’s duration,
gradually lengthening them as his proficiency increases. <i>He
should when on tour endeavour to apply the knowledge which
he has gained on the practice ground, and on the practice ground
he should try to overcome those difficulties which he has encountered
on tour.</i> There is no sense in keeping on climbing up and
sliding straight down the same easy hill; yet such is the
commonest form of ski-ing at fashionable Swiss winter resorts!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>As soon as the beginner can “turn on the spot,” run straight
fairly well, and “stem,” he <i>can</i> (we do not say he <i>should</i>) go
where he pleases. He will, however, remain slow and awkward,
and he will miss a great deal of the beauty of the sport if he rests
content with these easy accomplishments. We trust that he will
be of a more ambitious disposition, and that he will proceed to
the mastery of the “S” turn and of the “Telemark” and
“Christiania” swings; and we strongly recommend him to learn
something of jumping, not only on account of the amusement
which he will certainly derive from it, but because it is the very
best means of gaining a good balance for ordinary running.</p>

<p>It is of the greatest importance to cultivate a freedom and
elasticity of movement and position. The muscles should be as
strong as iron, but as flexible as rope. The knees should be
pliant, and should act like the springs of a carriage in relation to
the rest of the body. Be watchful, but courageous, and try hard
not to fall.</p>

<h4 id="LEAN_FORWARD">LEAN FORWARD!</h4>

<p>Lean forward is the watchword of the ski-runner, and it is
just as well to explain what is meant by it before proceeding
further.</p>

<p>Place your ski parallel, one about a foot in front of the other,
and throw the body forward as much as possible; one ought to
feel as if about to fall on one’s nose. To the onlooker one seems
to be standing on the <i>entire</i> sole of the foot, but in reality all
the weight rests on the front part and the toes. Thus, stand
erect on the ski, the knees a little bent, and then lean forward
without bending any part of your body (especially not the region
of the hips) and without raising the heel; then you ought to
feel what is meant. Never assume a position as if sitting down
or about to do so, because that would press down the heel.
Every violation of this great rule of leaning forward is punished
by the ski “bolting” from under one.</p>

<h4 id="TO_LIFT_THE_POINT_OF_THE_SKI">TO LIFT THE POINT OF THE SKI.</h4>

<p>To lift the point of the ski seems a very simple matter,
but it is at least ten to one that the novice will do it wrong.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
Press the heel of the ski down on the ground with your heel,
and lift the point upwards with your toe. <i>Do not raise any part
of your foot from the ski.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig013" src="images/fig013.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Turning on the Spot.</p></div>

<p>To lift the heel of the ski reverse the above. Here it will
not be possible to keep the heel of the foot on the heel of the
ski, but the binding will raise the latter from the ground to
some extent.</p>

<h4 id="TURNING_ON_THE_SPOT">TURNING ON THE SPOT.</h4>

<p>Turning on the spot is a puzzle to the beginner, though simple
when shown.</p>

<p>Lift one ski straight to the front (<a href="#fig013">see Fig. 13</a> (1)), putting
the heel end as far away from you as you can, then turn it outwards
and away from you smartly, swinging the point right
round and leaving the heel resting on the snow, then put it
down, point by heel, alongside of the other ski. This twisted
position (<a href="#fig013">Fig. 13</a> (2)) is the only difficulty, but very few
attempts will soon show that it is not so bad or cramped as it
seemed at first. In this position hold the knees slightly bent.
Lastly, <i>raise the point</i> of the other ski and swing it round. You
will find it easier to learn this movement with the assistance of
your stick, which should first be held obliquely across the body,
pointing in the opposite direction to that in which you are
turning. Then after assuming position (2) shift it across as in
(3), and lastly swing round the other ski. As soon as you are
proficient with the help of the stick practise without it&mdash;and, of
course, both to right and to left. It is not necessary to stand
on the snow in order to learn these movements. The carpet will
do, but remove all Dresden china from the immediate neighbourhood.</p>

<h4 id="WALKING_WITH_SKI_ON_THE_LEVEL">WALKING WITH SKI ON THE LEVEL.</h4>

<p>Walking with ski on the level differs from ordinary
walking or skating in this, that <i>one must not strike out</i>,
there being no fulcrum or point of resistance. Keep the ski
<i>parallel</i> and <i>as close together as possible</i> (closer than shown in
the diagram), for a narrow spoor has many advantages, besides
being “good form.” Throw the weight of the body forward
and <i>slide on the advanced leg</i>; the “hind” leg must be absolutely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
disengaged&mdash;that is to say, do not strike out by trying to
press the snow with it. Begin with long, slow steps, lunging
forward with bent knee (<a href="#fig014">Fig 14</a>). Do not lift the ski from the
ground, but slide along regularly and conscientiously; do not
hurry or flurry, but save your breath. In one’s first steps one
must specially cultivate precision, sliding forward with ski
exactly parallel, and distributing the weight properly. Lean
forward! slide!<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;On the Level.</p>

<p>The ski should be kept closer together than shown. The closer the better.</p></div>

<p>A single stick on the level is of but little service, but with
two sticks the pace can be considerably increased, especially on a
good firm surface. Both sticks should be thrown forward
simultaneously, and the slide on the advanced leg accelerated
by a vigorous push with both arms. When proceeding in this
way it is well to observe some kind of rhythm; and, as the snow
is seldom slippery enough to admit of a push at each step, one
should run, for example, one, two, three steps (swinging the
sticks forward), and then push with the arms, sliding on, say, the
right leg; then run one, two, three steps and push, sliding on the
left leg, and so on.</p>

<h4 id="UP_HILL">UP-HILL.</h4>

<p>To the laity it is a matter for wonder how it is possible
to climb any considerable hill at all on ski. We remember
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
well the look of polite incredulity which passed across the
face of a mountaineering friend some years ago when we told
him that a certain well-known pass in the Alps had been
traversed in winter. He had tried ski himself, but had made
very little of them, and the pass in question is a stiff one to
negotiate even in summer. But now long climbs on ski in
winter have become so common that it is unnecessary to pursue
the subject further than to quote the classical observation of
Olaus Magnus, “There exists no mountain, however high, which
by means of cunning by-ways he (the ski-runner) cannot
surmount.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_057" src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Stiff Climb.</span></p>

<p class="copy"><i>Photo by E. C. Richardson.</i></p></div>

<p>It is, however, well to observe here that some of the accounts
of the ease with which one can climb hills on ski have been
exaggerated. In rare conditions of perfect snow one may perhaps
ascend as quickly as in summer, but, roughly speaking, it
may be said that ski are about twenty-five per cent. slower up-hill
than boots. We are here, of course, speaking of climbing a
steep mountain where it is necessary to zig-zag (see <i>infra</i>), and
not of walking straight up a moderate slope. Moreover, whether
we slide the ski upwards in winter or whether we carry a corresponding
weight on our backs in summer, the fact remains that
some 10lb. or so have to be raised so many feet, and we are
handicapped to that extent. Where ski really have the advantage
is after the summit has been reached&mdash;of which more anon.</p>

<p>Up to a certain degree of steepness (varying with the quality
of the snow) there is little or no difference between the methods
used for climbing and for walking on the level. Snow is not an
absolutely slippery substance, and the ski always adhere to it to
some extent. There comes, however, very soon a point beyond
which we can no longer slide as on the level, and shortly after-wards
another, where the force of gravity overcomes the “stickiness”
of the snow and we begin to slip back. These points are
very different with the expert and the beginner, and the former
will slide easily straight up a slope upon which the latter will
slip hopelessly.</p>

<p>In ascending a steep incline the art lies (1) in knowing (and
only experience can teach one) just how steeply one can go
without a slip; (2) in the correct placing of the ski in the snow;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
and (3) in the correct balancing of the body upon the ski when so
placed. The correct placing of the ski is not a difficult matter.
The secret lies in raising the point of the ski (<a href="#Page_53">p. 53</a>) an inch
or two from the ground and bringing it <i>straight</i> down with a
<i>firm</i> stamp. The stamp is at first nearly always made too gently
by ladies and too hard by men. Imagine you are cracking a
walnut&mdash;that will be about right. Remember that <i>where the
foot is brought down there it must stop</i>. If it slips even the
least tiny bit you must stamp again.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig015" src="images/fig015.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;<i>Climbing a slope.</i>&mdash;<i>s</i> = the fall of the slope; <i>t</i> = turn here.
The shaded parts are obstructions (rocks, thick growth, &amp;c.).</p></div>

<p>Next bring the weight forward as evenly as possible on to the
ski you have stamped, and advance the other leg. In doing so
take the greatest care to balance the weight of the body <i>straight
over</i> the stamped ski; lean neither backwards nor forwards, or
you are certain to slip.</p>

<p>In hill-climbing it is, of course, expedient to go as steeply as
possible, but the beginner will find that it pays best to take
things easily at first, as a single slip backwards is more exhausting
than twenty steps forwards.</p>

<p>To negotiate a steep slope one must go across and upward at a
convenient angle, making a zig-zag track, as an engineer would
plan a good mountain road (<a href="#fig015">Fig 15</a>). Turn at the corners as
described, p. 55, and when so doing remember to assume a safe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
standing position, for a slip on a steep slope may be attended by
unpleasant consequences. The correct position in which to stand
before turning is clearly with the ski horizontally in space&mdash;that
is to say, at right angles to the direction of the gradient; then
one cannot slip while engrossed in the task.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;“<i>Herring-boning.</i>”&mdash;The figure is in the act of lifting the right

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p></div>

<p>The diagrams on page 59 show two other methods of hill-climbing
which are chiefly useful for short slopes. They are
both too fatiguing to be employed for any length of time. A
modification of the style shown in <a href="#fig017">Fig. 17</a> is, however, very
useful, especially on crusted snow. It consists in going forwards
and upwards at the same time, lifting the ski at every step.
This is not so very tiring, and may on a hard surface be kept up
for a considerable length of time without undue fatigue. The
track formed will appear as under.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_060.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>It is important when proceeding in this way to remember,
when lifting the <i>upper</i> ski, <i>to raise its heel from the snow</i> (<a href="#Page_55">see
p. 55</a>) <i>and place it well up-hill in a horizontal position</i>. Most
beginners move only the front part of the ski, and place it in the
snow with the heel pointing down hill. Even if the upper ski
does not slip in this wrong position (as usually happens), the
lower ski, when it comes to be lifted, is sure to be placed across
the heel of the upper ski, imprisoning it and preventing the
next step being taken. You are certain to make this mistake
very frequently at first, and it will land you in all sorts of
difficulties and entanglements, but do not forget that we warned
you against it.</p>

<p>A single stick is not of any very positive assistance up-hill,
though it has a negative value on <i>very</i> steep ground both in
aiding the balance and in giving a feeling of security against
slipping. In traversing a slope it should be held across the body
with the point touching the snow on the upper side. The
beginner will also find it useful to assist him in rising to his feet
after a fall. He should, however, entirely abandon all idea of
pulling himself up-hill with his stick; to do so is quite impossible.
Balance is what is required, <i>plus</i> a little thigh muscle, which will
come with practice.</p>

<p>Two sticks are, however, of considerable help, especially on
moderate slopes up which it is possible to go straight. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
should be placed in the snow alternately, after the manner which
nature dictates. In traversing steep ground they cease to
be of service, for the lower one is not long enough to reach the
slope below one’s feet, and the upper one cannot be used
effectively on the bank at one’s side. Under such circumstances
it is better, and safer, to hold them together and to use
them as one, as described above.</p>

<p>In general for long climbs it is best to go comparatively slowly
and to “keep at it.” The speed of a party should be that of the
slowest man. If you happen to be that unfortunate individual,
don’t lag behind if you can help it, but don’t hesitate to shout
to the others if they are going too fast for you. If, however,
they are novices and persist in rushing, slow down and go your
own pace. It is not at all improbable that if you go steadily
you may be the first at the top, after all; but even if you arrive
twenty minutes later than the others you are in no wise dishonoured.</p>

<p>Strictly between ourselves, we rather like to be last man, and
to allow our more energetic friends to go on ahead. The last
man has far the easiest place on a newly made track, and we do
not thirst for the glory of breaking the snow.</p>

<p>But, of course, a properly organised party should keep together,
and its members should take it in turns to go ahead.
It is in itself a pleasure to move steadily upwards in this way,
the ski and the sticks keeping time, and it makes the way seem
shorter and easier for everybody.</p>

<p>One concluding word of advice may here be given. Eat your
lunch some little distance below your intended highest point.
The tops of mountains and passes are apt to be draughty, and,
besides, it is much better to begin the run down when the
muscles are warm and supple than to wait till after they have
turned cold and stiff from sitting about.</p>

<h4 id="GLIDING_DOWN">GLIDING DOWN.</h4>

<p>Gliding down is the characteristic part of ski-running, as
distinct from the use of pattens, Canadian snow-shoes, &amp;c.
It is the reward reaped after the labours of the climb. The
ascent is, indeed, a struggle against gravity, but the descent is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
the highest advantage that any physical exercise can safely
derive from terrestrial attraction.</p>

<p>Let us imagine ourselves on the top of some long Norwegian
mountain ready for the plunge. There is a clear course between
the steep rocks near the top, and an open run across the glacier
below to the terminal moraine a mile off. We can see every
yard of the way, and all is fair going, yet we feel just the merest
tinge of nervousness, for the incline is steep, and looks steeper
than it is. But there is really no danger, so it is over the edge
and off! In an instant all fears are left behind, for now balance
and quickness of eye are to be put to the test, and the wind is
whistling and the snow dust spurting. We whiz past the rocks
and over a few inequalities, negotiated here by a spring and a
flight of a few yards through the air and there by a compensating
yielding of the knees. Now we rush out on to the smooth
surface of the glacier, where there is no jar and no vibration.
Our feet seem to have vanished, and we lean, as it were, in space,
with the ice-wind pressed against us. There is no more need
for balancing, and no thought of falling, so even is the motion
and so trustworthy the snow. Smoothly our wooden wings bear
us onwards, and the furlongs lie behind! But the end
approaches, the slope becomes less steep, the pace slackens, and
presently we glide gently up the opposite slope of the moraine
and turn to watch our companions.</p>

<p>Such is the best picture we can give you of a good straight
glissade on ski; but there is not the slightest reason, friend
novice, why you yourself should not enjoy the reality ere long.
You must, however, learn to walk before you can run, and we
would have you make your first attempts on some quite easy
slope, removed if possible from the public gaze. A few obstacles,
such as trees, scattered about do not matter, as you are not in
the least likely to run into them, and they serve to accustom
the eye to their presence. If possible, let there be a gradual
outrun at the bottom of the hill. Practise there awhile, and
as soon as you can run down without a fall move on somewhere
else to a place where the ground is steeper and more uneven.</p>

<p>To start on steep ground is a little difficult at first. Stand
horizontally to the direction of the slope. Then <i>as quickly as</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
<i>possible</i> lift round first the lower and then the upper ski. Lean
forward and off! If you are quick and lean forward, the ski
will not bolt from under you; if you are slow and hang back,
they will.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig018" src="images/fig018.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;<i>Gliding on ski.</i>&mdash;1. Correct position; 2 and 3. Dangerous and
incorrect.</p></div>

<p>The correct position for descending a hill is that shown in
<a href="#fig018">Fig. 18</a> (1) above. Keep the ski parallel and <i>as close together
as you can</i> (touching if possible), advance one foot about twelve
inches, and let the main weight of the body rest on the ball of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
the “hind” foot; feel your way, so to speak, with the front
foot. <i>Lean forward. Bend the knees slightly, and be as free
and as elastic about them as possible.</i> Practise with either foot
leading. Avoid any affected and ridiculous pose. Do not, for
example, if you are running without a stick, hold the arms
straight out from the body as though you were walking a tight-rope.
To do so may slightly assist the balance, but you cannot
run like this with a stick in your hand, and it is far better not
to get into bad habits. No. 3 in the diagram (p. 63) is a very
common attitude, but it is as bad as bad can be. The wide
spoor is a cause of instability, the <i>extreme</i> bending of the knee
is a source of weakness, and there is a very fair chance of the
runner (if he falls forward) knocking out his front teeth against
his stick. Hold that article <i>clear of the ground</i> in a safe position
as shown (No. 1, p. 63), and practise sometimes without it.
<i>Above all things, do not lean backwards on to the pole</i>, for the
consequence of so doing is that the upper part of the body is
retarded in its speed, and, being thus left further and further
behind, a spill on lumpy ground becomes inevitable. There is
a right way of using the pole for braking and turning, which
will be explained further on, but until some little skill in simple
straight glissading is gained it is best not to trouble about this.
We strongly advise you in the meanwhile not to use the stick at
all, but, for reasons previously stated (see pp. 44 and 45), to
practise with it held in the hand clear of the ground.</p>

<p>Double sticks should be held up one in each hand or trailed
behind.</p>

<p>The position shown in <a href="#fig018">Fig. 18</a> (1) is the safest position for
running over unbroken snow, for by advancing the foot one
lengthens the running surface and so glides more easily over
any inequalities, and by holding the ski together one is less
disturbed by any lateral irregularities. But on an icy road it
will be found easier to run with the feet more level and somewhat
apart, for there another disturbing factor, side slip, comes
into play.</p>

<p>So, again, when changes of the snow’s surface are likely to
occur, causing the ski at one time to run freely and at another
to stick, it will be found better to crouch close down to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
ground, for by doing so one lowers the centre of gravity, and is
less likely to be pitched forward when entering the slow snow.
And there will be other occasions when the runner will find it
necessary to more or less modify the position shown in
Fig. 18 (1). Nevertheless, this attitude may safely be considered
the <i>normal</i> one for descending hills on ski, and the
beginner is recommended to study it carefully, and to adhere
to it as closely as circumstances will permit.</p>

<h4 id="FALLING_AND_GETTING_UP">FALLING AND GETTING UP.</h4>

<p>As to the former, we beg to offer Mr. Punch’s advice
to those about to marry&mdash;“don’t.” Every ski-runner falls
more or less, the beginner very much, the expert very
rarely. But most novices are apt to throw themselves
down far oftener than there is any occasion for. Do not,
therefore, give up simply because you lose your balance a
little; very frequently if you try hard you will be able to keep
upright. If you make up your mind to “stand” down a
difficult hill, the chances are that you will succeed in doing so;
but if you are nervous and hang back, you are almost certain
to come to grief. It is specially true of ski-running that
fortune favours the brave. When, however, a fall cannot be
avoided, we would advise you, if possible, to cast yourself down
sideways and backwards; but if the whole affair is beyond your
control, then relax every muscle in your body and let yourself
go. Make no attempt to save yourself or stop rolling. Then
there will be no snapping of tense sinews.</p>

<p>You will generally find out the easiest way of getting up for
yourself, but two little artifices may here be mentioned. One
is to get on to the back of your ski in deep snow; and the other
is to bring the ski below you on a steep slope and to place them
at right angles to the gradient before attempting to rise.</p>

<h4 id="SLIGHT_CHANGES_OF_DIRECTION">SLIGHT CHANGES OF DIRECTION.</h4>

<p>Slight changes of direction can be made by leaning the body a
little this way or that. This is very easy, and requires no
explanation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<h4 id="SKATING">“SKATING.”</h4>

<p>Another way of steering is to lift one of the ski and
place it down in the direction in which one wishes to go,
at the same time striking out with the other foot as in skating.
This accomplishment is not exactly pretty, but it is very useful.
One can thus help the ski round a bend in a road or thread
one’s way down a gentle slope amongst trees without losing
speed. It is, however, impossible to execute a very rapid turn
in this manner. A good way of practising “skating” is to do
a sort of “inside edge” on any firm surface (<i>e.g.</i>, a snow-covered
lake) on the level. One strikes out with the ski in the same
manner as with skates on ice.</p>

<h4 id="BRAKING_WITH_THE_STICK">BRAKING WITH THE STICK.</h4>

<p>This method of controlling the speed has been the subject of a
good deal of discussion. The objections to it are (1) that it is a
less powerful method than any of the others to be mentioned later
on; (2) that it requires greater strength; (3) that the stick is liable
to break and leave the runner helpless; (4) that <i>its constant
use is conducive to a bad style of running, spoiling the balance,
and making the learning of the other movements more difficult</i>.
Nevertheless, we doubt whether even the cleverest novice will
be able to stop quickly by means of the “Telemark” or
“Christiania” swings for at least a month or two, and most
people will take far longer to learn to do them even moderately
well. How, then, are the poor things to manage in the meantime?
“By snow-ploughing and by stemming,” you reply. Certainly,
but the fact is that with these methods when no stick is used it
is quite impossible, when travelling very fast, to stop suddenly,
though with the help of the stick it is easy to do so.</p>

<p>But we will here go a step further and assert that there are
places and conditions of snow where the use of the stick becomes
imperative even to the expert, as, for example, when traversing
a steep and crusted slope with a precipice below it. We propose
therefore, to deal with the proper way of managing it
before proceeding further.</p>

<p><i>The important thing to remember in using the stick is to hold
it quite short</i>, and <i>as far in front as possible</i>. Do not let it
drag behind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>The accompanying diagrams illustrate a right and a wrong
method. Note that in (1) the left forearm and hand of the
runner should rest against the inside of the shin of his left
(advanced) leg. The left hand serves as a fulcrum, the long end
of the lever being held in the right. Considerable power may be
obtained in this manner, but it is not always feasible on lumpy
ground. You must use your own judgment as to when to employ
it, bearing in mind the above principle. But, above all things,
do not assume the position depicted in (2). Here, even though
the entire weight of the body rests on the stick, its braking
value (owing to the angle at which it touches the snow) is very
slight. In this position the ski gradually slide further and
further ahead, leaving the stick, with the runner clinging to it,
further and further behind; all balance and all control are
lost, and as soon as a little inequality is met with a spill occurs.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig019" src="images/fig019.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;<i>Braking with the stick.</i>&mdash;1. A right way; 2. A wrong way.</p></div>

<p>There exists a way of sitting with the <i>thigh</i> on the pole (<i>not</i>
with the junction of the legs) for braking on narrow, steep, and
icy roads, where all other means are simply out of the question
(<a href="#fig020">see Fig. 20</a>); and for the successful execution of this manœuvre
it is necessary to note the following points very carefully.
Assuming one wishes to sit on the left thigh, then the left hand
grasps the end of the pole which protrudes below. Let this
hand be close to the seat, and let the part of the stick between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
hand and point be as short as possible. The right hand <i>rests
on the right knee</i>, and seizes the upper end of the pole. This
is important, for it is the use of the knee as a support for the
upper hand which gives rigidity to the whole arrangement and
allows one to hold out over long distances. The leg&mdash;the one
on which one sits (in the example to the left)&mdash;is stretched out in
front, and by shifting the weight from the ski to the point of
the pole one can stop instantly, even on clear ice.</p>

<h4 id="SNOW_PLOUGHING">SNOW-PLOUGHING.</h4>

<p>We now come to a better method of stopping and
braking. Snow-ploughing is used for reducing the pace and
stopping <i>when running straight down</i>. In principle it is
very simple, and it is quite easy to learn. The heels of the
ski are pressed apart, and the toes held together, by which means
a V-shaped kind of plough is formed, the friction of which
against the snow causes one to stop. The wider the angle of the
V the greater, of course, will be the braking power. The weight
is distributed evenly between the two ski, and when the snow
is hard both are turned slightly on to their inner edges. When
the snow is soft it is best to hold them flat. The method is
particularly serviceable on a hard road, and under such conditions,
even when travelling fast, it can be employed quite
suddenly without fear of accidents. But on soft snow any
attempt to use it when running fast will result in the ski crossing
and a fall forwards. Under such conditions nobody has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
strength enough to hold the ski apart. One must accordingly
stop (by some other means) and then, if one wishes to proceed
slowly, place the ski in the V-shaped position and restart.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Reconnoitring.</span> Half-way up Piz Nier.</p>

<p class="copy"><i>Photo by E. C. Richardson.</i></p></div>

<p>The stick is a useful adjunct to snow-ploughing, and <a href="#fig021">Fig. 21</a>
shows a serviceable way of holding it.</p>

<h4 id="SIDE_SLIPPING">SIDE-SLIPPING.</h4>

<p>On <i>very</i> steep slopes, especially if such be icy, it is
sometimes necessary to slip down sideways. This is simply
accomplished by holding the ski at right angles to the
fall of the slope and keeping them <i>flat</i> on the snow (or ice-crust)
instead of edging them. The stick is held in the snow
above the runner, and assists him in preserving his balance,
for the motion is necessarily somewhat irregular. Side-slipping
is, however, nothing but a method of descending a dangerous
slope where snow-ploughing, “stemming,” &amp;c. (see <i>infra</i>), are
out of the question. It is not amusing or pretty, but merely
occasionally useful.</p>

<h4 id="STEMMING">STEMMING.</h4>

<p>Stemming is akin to snow-ploughing, and by some German
writers the stemming position is termed the half-snow-plough
position. It is a most valuable way of reducing the speed when
<i>traversing</i> a slope which one does not desire to, or cannot,
descend straight, and it is also of great service for turning and
stopping under all circumstances. Whilst of ancient origin and
known to all good Norwegian runners, stemming is but little
used in Norway. The chief reasons for this are that the ground
in that country is not in general steep enough to necessitate
traversing, and that most Norwegians are from early childhood
familiar with the more difficult Telemark and Christiania
swings. On the Continent, however, the ground is usually
steeper and the skill of the runner less, and there stemming has
been found to be very useful. We have no hesitation in recommending
the beginner to learn it at this stage if he wants to
tour as soon as possible, and eventually to become a good all-round
ski-runner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>At Lilienfeld, a small village near Vienna, stemming was hit
upon, quite independently, by a Herr Zdarsky (an Austrian
gentleman to whom we have already referred), who turned
a philosophical mind to its scientific development. The
description which we give of it is practically the same as that
given in his book. Herr Zdarsky recommends the use of his own
special binding, and employs a shortish, smooth-bottomed ski
with a bluff entrance. We have found, however, that the movements
can be made with any good firm binding and with any
ski, though they are undoubtedly easier, both to learn and to
accomplish, on a flat-bottomed short ski, than on a relatively
long and grooved ski. (<a href="#Page_32">See p. 32</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig022" src="images/fig022.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span>&mdash;<i>Stemming.</i></p></div>

<p>In learning stemming one distinguishes between the “glider”
(the sliding ski) and the “braker” (the stemming ski). On a
hillside the glider is the upper of the two. The glider must
point in the direction in which one wishes to go. The lower ski,
the braker, is kept a little behind the other, so as to prevent
the glider crossing it, and is held in the position shown in the
above diagram (<a href="#fig022">Fig 22</a>). In order to ensure smooth and
accurate progress it is highly important to remember to <i>keep
both ski flat on the snow</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>Begin by running obliquely across and down a good steep
slope in this position, <i>keeping all the weight of the body on the
glider, and merely brushing the snow lightly with the braker</i>.
Choose a gradient of sufficient steepness to keep you moving at a
rate of, say, three or four miles an hour, and endeavour to run
smoothly and to keep in a straight line.</p>

<p>In practising this you will discover that by pressing more or
less on the braker you can turn up-hill, stop, or go slow, just as
you please. We accordingly formulate directions for so doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Turn Up-hill.</span>&mdash;Press lightly on the braker, edging it into
the snow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Stop.</span>&mdash;Press hard, and turn the body up-hill. You will
find yourself come round with a swing. This method of stopping
can, of course, be used anywhere&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, on the level after running
straight down, where, if one wishes to stop by (say) a turn to
the right, one stems with the left ski, at the same time turning
the body to the right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Slightly Reduce the Speed.</span>&mdash;Press a little on the braker
without altering your direction.</p>

<p>Practise these three things patiently, constantly remembering
the injunctions: Glider flat! Weight on glider! (or on braker,
to stop!) Lean forward! Heels apart! Points together!
(which latter means that one must keep the tip of the braker
close to the <i>side</i> of the glider, and about a foot behind its tip).</p>

<p>On hard snow both ski will have to be edged so as to afford a
grip on the impenetrable surface and to prevent side-slip. And
between the extremes of the softest and the hardest snow the
runner will discover many instances where he may have to edge
the braker a little while going. But let him, all the same,
interpret these remarks as absolutely as he can, and always try
hard to hold the ski <i>as flat as possible</i>.</p>

<p><i>Practise on steep ground</i>, because there mistakes are more
easily discovered, and the correct way soon proclaims its
advantages.</p>

<p>Fig. 23 illustrates the proper position for the ski in stemming.
The arrow “s” is the fall of the slope, for the reader is looking
straight at the mountain; “d” is the direction in which the
runner wishes to go obliquely across this slope. This direction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
is on the whole that of the glider “g.” The braker “b”
brushes the snow with its entire length, thus producing a <i>broad</i>
track, the direct evidence of the braking power&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, friction.
Therefore, weight <i>off</i> the braker for going, <i>on</i> for stopping. The
steeper the slope the wider must be the angle formed by the two
ski. The little circle “p” shows whereabouts the point of the
pole should be&mdash;that is, a little behind the upper foot.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig023" src="images/fig023.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span>&mdash;<i>Position for the ski in stemming.</i></p></div>

<p>The pole may be used to facilitate balance when executing
these movements, its point lightly furrowing the snow. It will
also be found to considerably assist a sudden stop, for by pressing
it into the ground and throwing all the weight on to the braker
the glider becomes entirely disengaged, and there is less chance
of its crossing the braker, as is otherwise apt to happen when
running very fast. Hold the pole fairly short, do not lean back
on it, and do not use it more than is really necessary.</p>

<h4 id="TO_MAKE_A_DOWN_HILL_CURVE">TO MAKE A DOWN-HILL CURVE.</h4>

<p>The foregoing section gave the beginner directions for turning
quickly up-hill, but how shall he, when crossing a steep slope,
turn quickly down-hill and, without stopping, continue his
traverse in the opposite direction?</p>

<p>To do this is evidently a most valuable accomplishment, for if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
the runner cannot achieve it he is obliged at the end of his
traverse to stop and turn as described on p. 55 before he can
start off again on the other tack.</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>Here is the easiest way to learn.</p>

<p>First reduce the speed by a vigorous “stem,” <i>taking care not
to turn up-hill</i> in so doing. Then, keeping <i>both</i> ski rigidly <i>flat</i>
and holding the heels far apart and the points of the ski close
together, turn the body down-hill. <span class="smcap">Lean forward, and throw
all the weight on to the outside (lower) ski.</span></p>

<p>You will then, if you have followed these directions <i>in every
particular</i>, come round with a delightful swish and find yourself
starting off comfortably in the other direction.</p>

<p>Change the stick to the other side of the body when about
half round, because at that instant one is almost stationary for
half a second or so.</p>

<p>The more one pulls the heels apart the shorter and neater the
curve will be.</p>

<p>If success does not follow, it is due to some mistake, such as
not leaning forward (one will then sit down), or edging the ski
(they catch in the snow and overthrow the runner), or not
tearing the heels sufficiently apart and throwing the weight on
to the lower ski (which causes one to go off at a tangent instead
of completing the arc).</p>

<p>The words of command for the curve are, then: Lean forward!
Ski flat! Heels apart! Weight on the lower ski!</p>

<p>The diagrams pp. 73 and 75 should be of assistance in enabling
the beginner to understand what is meant. On a really steep
hill it requires a considerable amount of nerve to make up one’s
mind to plunge for an instant headlong downwards. One’s
natural inclination is to hang back and lean inwards, but this is
precisely what one must not do.</p>

<p>The stick will be found to be of considerable assistance in
making this curve, a little touch with it in the snow just as one
is coming round being a great help to the balance. When shifting
it across as above described, hold it rather short and place it
in the snow well <i>in front of you</i>. This will assist you in leaning
forward. Do not, however, attempt to spin round leaning on it;
to do so throws the weight inside, which is quite fatal. It is, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
course, perfectly possible to make the turn without a stick at all,
but to do so is difficult on very steep ground. Practise on a
moderate slope to begin with; when you become proficient move
on to steeper and yet steeper places; but, of course, look out
for avalanches!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig025" src="images/fig025.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span>&mdash;Positions 1-5 arranged on a curve. It must, however, be
remembered that in nature the movements follow so closely that the ski on the
drawing would have to overlap. The sweep of a well-made curve clears a
semi-lunar space with a wall of snow at its lower rim.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig026" src="images/fig026.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span> Shows this.</p></div>

<p>Coming down a long and complicated slope one joins one
curve to another without a break, thus dodging the trees and
rocks. On a steep incline, if there are obstacles in the way of a
straight descent, the S-track, as it is called, affords a safe
reduction of speed and a prolongation of the pleasurable
slide.</p>

<p>The ski-runner who has reached this stage enjoys himself
wherever there is snow, even if there be little of it, for he can
circumvent the patches where it has melted away. The photograph
on the opposite page shows what can be done after a single
winter’s patient practice. It is a “snake-line” made in the winter
of 1903 by one of the writers of this chapter, and by no means
an accomplishment requiring more than ordinary skill or talent.
The slope in question descends from Alp Laret, near St. Moritz,
to the valley in which lies the world-famed Cresta toboggan run.
The gradient is between 40 deg. and 50 deg. (55 deg. to 60 deg.
near the top), and the vertical distance from top to bottom
amounts to exactly 300 metres (1,000ft.). The small avalanche
about the middle was started by the ski of the runner, and the
marks and remains of older avalanches on the left give sufficient
testimony as to the steepness of the spot. The length of the run
must be at least half a mile, and the entire distance was covered
without a single fall or stumble. May the beginner draw the
proper conclusion: that where there’s a will there’s a way, and
that both in this case are within the reach of the ordinary
individual who can walk, row, shoot, ride, play tennis, cricket, or
football.</p>

<p>What is it that makes the votary of the slender plank count
the shortening days, and greet with boyish glee the slowly
falling flakes? What makes him tremble with excitement at the
sight of the whitening hills? It is the memory of past delights,
the impatience to taste them again. He sees himself on the
top of the mountain. From his feet a vista of stately firs on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
a slope of dazzling white stretches away into the valley a
thousand feet below. Above, the clear blue sky. Off he goes!
For ten minutes the swish of the spurting snow is sweet music to
his ears; for ten minutes he scorns the soaring albatross, as he
feels himself buoyed by the feathering ski, swaying from curve
to curve. The excitement of the start has left him, and though
ten minutes may seem a short time he enjoys them to the full,
for he is calm, and glides easily, without a show of strength,
without effort or strain. He feels the mighty power of the rush,
the living force which is gathering as he flies, which drives him
along, but which is nevertheless under his absolute control. He
toys with the weight that impels him; by small movements
of his ski he steers and directs the energy within. He can
make the snow yield like water, or resist like steel. He is
swung from turn to turn, irresistibly, but with safe and stately
motion, by the force which he commands; he feels himself
rocking softly, like the petrel on the waves.</p>

<p>Then comes the end; the stream at the bottom is near. A
sudden twist; a swirling cloud of white, and, as the crystals
settle glittering in the sun, there one sees him firm and erect,
the ruler of the mountain, the master of the snow and ski!</p>

<h4 id="THE_TELEMARK_SWING">THE “TELEMARK” SWING.</h4>

<p>We now come to other more rapid, more brilliant, and
more difficult methods of turning and coming to a sudden
standstill. The stemming turn can hardly be performed
quickly when running very fast without the aid of the
stick, especially when long grooved ski are used. But with
the “Telemark” and “Christiania” swings, about to be
described, a good runner can stop suddenly almost anywhere
when travelling much faster. It is indeed a worthy sight to see
such a one come sailing past, his every sinew as pliable and
strong as the good ash beneath his feet, yielding to each dip, as a
smart racing vessel yields to the waves. Twenty-five miles an
hour he is travelling, and not a furlong less. To stop suddenly
at such a speed seems impossible. But, swish! and he is round
as easily and as quickly as you can read these words. How was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
it done? It was all so rapid you could not follow. You saw a
little sinking on one knee&mdash;perhaps not even that. The snow
hid nearly everything. You slide up to our friend and ask him
to show you what he did. He will be most polite and most
anxious for you to learn&mdash;especially if he be a Norwegian, as
will almost certainly prove to be the fact. You will be shown
just how to place your feet, and just how to bend the knees, and
just how to lean the body. And you will start off and fail hopelessly
again and again. By and by, however, especially if your
teacher be an intelligent man who has had previous experience
with beginners, you will begin to understand the knack of the
movement, and by the end of the afternoon you should be
rewarded by some measure of success.</p>

<p>But perhaps you may not be fortunate enough to meet with
such a runner, or, what is by no means improbable, it may be
that, though a clever performer on ski, he is not a good
instructor. He makes the swing, but knows not himself how he
does it. And small blame to him, for how many people trouble
to analyse the things they have learnt as children?</p>

<p>We venture to offer our services. But is it possible to learn
these subtle manœuvres from a book? Most certainly it is; but
you must either take it with you into the field, or else (what is
as good, or better) have some preliminary practice in your bed-room,
where you will have only your looking-glass for an
audience, and no small boy in the immediate neighbourhood to
point the finger of scorn. If you do this, we are sure that you
will learn very quickly, or if you fail, then our instructions must
be wrong. If, however, you simply glance through what we have
written without making practical experiments, book in hand, we
can accept no responsibility. These turns are really not at all
hard to make fairly well, which is all that we can pretend to
teach; but to make them with certainty requires long practice.
And that is, of course, entirely your own affair.</p>

<p>We propose to deal with the “Telemark” first&mdash;not because
it is easier or more useful, for in this respect there is little to
choose between them, but because it is customary to do so.
Besides, the Telemark is a much prettier swing than the
“Christiania,” and it will make a greater impression on your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
admiring friends should you be so lucky as to succeed in making
one when showing off.</p>

<p>You will not find your stick (on which we trust you are not
in the habit of riding) of the slightest assistance to you in
<i>learning</i> either of these swings. It <i>may</i> help you a little to
<i>make</i> the Christiania once you have acquired the knack of it,
but we are very doubtful even about that, and we strongly advise
that from now on you do not use it at all. Hold it in your hand,
except when jumping, as previously recommended (p. 45), but
make no attempt to use it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig027" src="images/fig027.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span>&mdash;The Telemark swing.</p></div>

<p>Each of these swings can be made in two directions&mdash;to right
or to left; and each has its special use for special occasions.
Apart, therefore, from being a graceful accomplishment and from
the excellent practice it affords, it is of considerable practical
value to be able to make all four of them. Nevertheless, most
people are content with one of each kind&mdash;a Telemark to the
left and a Christiania to the right&mdash;which enables them under
ordinary conditions to turn in either direction without changing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
the foot (see <i>infra</i>). But the best runners can make all four
swings, and we recommend you to emulate their example.</p>

<p>The Telemark swing is easiest in loose snow, where there is
little side slip. We find it rather easier on the level than the
Christiania (<i>e.g.</i>, to stop after making a jump), but it is more
difficult to make quickly on a hillside, and in general it is not
quite so rapid as the Christiania.</p>

<p><a href="#fig027">Fig. 27</a> (<i>a</i>) shows the position in which the body and limbs
are held throughout a Telemark swing to the left. It is convenient
to call this position the Telemark position. <a href="#fig027">Fig. 27</a> (<i>b</i>)
shows the position which the ski assume after the swing is over.</p>

<p>The following directions are for making a Telemark swing to
the left.</p>

<p>The directions for making a Telemark swing to the right are
identically the same, substituting left for right and right for left
throughout.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Make a Telemark Swing to the Left.</span>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) From the
normal position for running down (<a href="#Page_63">see p. 63</a>) advance the right
ski till the right ankle is opposite the bend of the left ski. Raise
the heel of the left foot off the left ski, bend the left knee, and
throw all the weight forward on to the right foot. (This is what
we mean by “the Telemark position.”) (<i>b</i>) Place the right ski
slightly on its left edge and turn and lean the whole body to the
left.</p>

<p>If these directions are correctly carried out, the runner will
come round with a sweep, the sharpness of which will depend
upon the force with which he turns his body as advised in (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>An excellent way of learning this turn is to practise running
straight down hill in the Telemark position. Note especially to
raise the heel of the left foot as shown. This is highly important,
and is, in fact, the key to the whole affair, for if the runner
raises his heel he is almost compelled to throw the weight
forward on to the right foot, and if he can once succeed in doing
this everything else is comparatively easy. So remember to
<i>raise the heel of the left foot and to kneel well down on the left
ski</i>. Cultivate as narrow a spoor as possible, and as soon as you
can run straight like this at a moderate speed try turning the
body ever such a little. <i>Look the way you wish to go.</i> You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
will be delighted to discover what a small amount of turning
will cause you to come round very quickly.</p>

<p>To compensate for the centrifugal force exercised by the turn
on the upper part of the body, you will have to lean inwards; in
fact, after you begin to get the knack of the thing, you are pretty
certain to be thrown outwards once or twice. But do not
trouble about that too much; <i>do not at first make any conscious
effort to lean inwards</i>, or you will probably fall in that direction;
you will very soon begin to compensate for the outward throw
quite unconsciously.</p>

<p>Do not try to turn too quickly when learning, but rather take
matters easily; <i>speed will come by and by</i>&mdash;in which connection
note that both the “Telemark” and the “Christiania” are
<i>swings</i> and <i>not jerks</i>, and that, however rapidly they be performed,
the body should be turned <i>crescendo</i> and <i>not</i> (to continue
the music metaphor) <i>sforzando</i>.</p>

<p>Another capital way of practising is to stand on some level
space at the edge of a steep hill in the position shown in
Fig. 27 (<i>a</i>) and then to slip over the edge and instantly to begin
to swing. This method will allow you to practise a great number
of swings in a short time without the trouble of walking a long
way up-hill in order to gain speed. The following diagram
shows graphically how to do so:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig028" src="images/fig028.jpg" alt="" />
<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;A C B is the edge of a steep slope falling in the direction of the
arrow. Stand at the point C. Slip over the edge, and at once make a swing to
the left, stopping at E. Walk up the dotted line to O, turn (<i>see</i> p. 55) and return
to C. Then make a swing to the right, stopping at D, and returning to C <i>via</i> L.
Next, run a little further down, and swing to G, &amp;c., &amp;c. In this manner the
difficulty of the swing is gradually increased.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p></div>

<p>The “Telemark” swing can also be used to make down-hill
turns in the manner described above, p. 72, and the principles
there given hold good here, except that the “Telemark”
position, instead of the stemming position, is held throughout.</p>

<p>A succession of S turns made in this way looks very pretty,
but on a very steep hill their execution becomes rather uncertain,
for the snow, unless perfect, is apt to slip irregularly,
and with a true “Telemark” the stick is no use to help matters
out. We have found, however, that a sort of half-stemming,
half-“Telemark” position plus a little stick is useful in inducing
long ski to come round.</p>

<h4 id="THE_CHRISTIANIA_SWING">THE “CHRISTIANIA” SWING.</h4>

<p>The “Christiania” swing differs materially from the “Telemark”
swing in this, that in making it the normal position
of the ski is retained, and the turn is effected in the direction of
the advanced foot&mdash;that is to say, to the right if the right foot is
leading, and to the left with the left foot in front. It is easiest
on hard snow and on steep hills, where the ski are liable to skid,
on which ground the “Telemark” is especially difficult.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig029" src="images/fig029.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;The Christiania swing.</p></div>

<p>The term “Christiania” swing for this movement appears to
be a misnomer. For we are assured on very high authority that
it was in common use in Telemarken long before the inhabitants
of the capital acquired any skill in the art of ski-running. We
are inclined to suspect that the name is of Continental origin,
for, though we practised the “Christiania” years ago in Norway,
we never there heard it called by any other name than “Telemarking.”
Be this, however, as it may, the turn in question is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
a perfectly distinct one, and well deserves a name of its own,
and, as it is known all over Switzerland, Germany, and Austria
as the “Christiania,” we have not dared to take upon us to
alter the name.</p>

<p>Besides being easier in shallow snow and on hillsides than the
Telemark, the Christiania is considerably the more rapid swing
of the two, and a skilful runner can by means of it stop suddenly
when travelling at almost any speed.</p>

<p><a href="#fig029">Fig. 29</a> shows the position which the ski usually assume
<i>after a swing to the right is over</i>, but diagrams are, in
describing this turn, of very little value, for the great secret of
success is to endeavour to hold the ski in the normal position
(<a href="#Page_63">see p. 63</a>) throughout.</p>

<p>Here are formal directions for making the swing to the right.
To make it to the left all that is necessary is to substitute left
for right and right for left throughout.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Make a “Christiania” Swing to the Right</span>:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) hold
the ski in the normal position (<a href="#Page_63">see p. 63</a>), <i>press the feet close
together</i> and distribute the weight evenly on both ski. Bend
both knees a little. (<i>b</i>) Gently <i>swing</i> the whole body, but
especially the region about the hips, round to the right, at the
same time leaning in that direction, throwing the weight on to
the <i>heels</i> and edging both ski.</p>

<p>You will, when you have mastered the knack of the movement,
be astonished how quickly you will come round. The ski will
assume the position above shown, and the weight will of itself
fall almost entirely on to the right foot. This latter fact
accounts, we believe, for the directions commonly given for
making this turn&mdash;viz., to swing almost entirely on the inner
(here the right) foot and to place the ski as shown. This was
also the description given in the first edition of this book, but a
closer analysis and more experience in teaching have induced us
to alter it. We have found that any conscious effort to swing on
the right foot and to place the ski in the position shown invariably
results in the left ski rushing off at a tangent. To avoid
this it is necessary to press the ski tightly together throughout
and to <i>begin</i> the turn with the weight evenly distributed on
both.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>Beginners will find that the great difficulty in this swing is to
get it started. It involves a peculiar kind of catch of the back
part of the ski in the snow, which is very difficult to explain.
Perhaps it will assist you to arrive at the sort of “feel” of the
movement if you place a chair in front of you and then (standing
before it in the normal position, and without moving the
feet) endeavour to sit down on it.</p>

<p>In this turn also the precepts given above as to swinging
easily and not jerking, and leaving the lean inwards to take care
of itself, apply.</p>

<p>It may also be practised after the manner shown in <a href="#fig028">Fig. 28</a>.</p>

<p><i>As a substitute for stemming a little of the swing is very
useful for braking when traversing a steep slope.</i> To practise
this select a steep hill and run straight for a short distance
obliquely down and across it; then make a little of the swing,
reducing the pace; then run straight again; and so on. This is
also a very good way of learning the turn itself.</p>

<p>There seems to be no reason why one should not make S turns
by means of the “Christiania” swing, though to do so must be
rather difficult.</p>

<p>In order to save time in changing the foot, skilful runners
when threading their way through a wood (for example) usually
make their turns by the “Telemark” for one direction and the
“Christiania” for the other.</p>

<p>In the above description we have advised the beginner to
learn the “Christiania” swing in the normal position with one
foot leading, but it can also be made with the feet perfectly
level. We well remember our delight and astonishment on one
occasion when we saw a first-class Norwegian runner, after
making a 70ft. jump, and when travelling at a great speed, avoid
colliding with a friend and two trees by making with wonderful
rapidity three “Christiania” swings&mdash;left, right, and left.</p>

<p>There are, of course, other ways of combining these various
methods of turning which an expert employs quite unconsciously.
Indeed, it is highly probable that your Norwegian friends will
never even have heard of a “Stemming turn” or a “Christiania
swing,” any more than a South Sea islander has heard of a verb
or an adjective. This does not, however, prevent the Norwegian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
from being an expert on ski or the coloured gentleman from
being a fluent speaker. Nor has it any bearing on the fact that
you as a foreigner will find a grammar of assistance in learning
Kanaka. It is our hope that the classification we have adopted
may similarly prove of assistance to you in becoming a proficient
ski-runner.

<span class="large">By <span class="smcap">E. C. Richardson</span>.</span></h2>

<hr class="short" />

<p>So many strange and perverted ideas prevail in England and on
the Continent as to what ski-jumping is, that it is, perhaps,
excusable to begin by mentioning a few of the things which it
is not. To begin with, there are people who think that ski are
a sort of seven-league boots on which one may fly across the
snow planes as fast as an express train, jumping any minor
obstacles, such as houses or trees, which happen to be in the
way. This is not so. Four or five miles per hour is very good
going on the level, and it is impossible to jump upwards from
the level over anything higher than a small gooseberry bush.
Again, one frequently hears that Norwegians are born on ski,
and jump before they can walk; but, though the writer of this
article has made every inquiry, he has, so far, failed to authenticate
a single case in point. The truth is that Norwegians of all
ages are fond of ski-running and jumping, but, owing to such
things as the melting of the snow in summer, extreme youth
and old age, business and the like, only a comparatively small
number are worthy to be called real experts. Further, it is not
the fact that a special exercise place, with an elaborately built
take-off, is essential. On most hills it is possible to build, in a
few minutes, a jump which will give entertainment both to the
skilful and unskilful; and it frequently happens in the course of
a tour that a little natural drop presents itself, from which one
may skim through the air for several yards before again touching
the snow. True that in Norway hills are specially prepared
and elaborate takeoffs built, but these are chiefly used for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
competitions, where long and difficult leaps and spectacular effect
are required. It cannot be too strongly insisted that the sport is
wholly independent of such things, and that, whilst the jump
affords by far the best means of judging the skill of a ski-runner,
its enjoyment is by no means dependent on elaborate construction
or mere competition.</p>

<p>Like other great sports, ski-jumping calls forth the qualities
of courage, skill, and endurance; a good jumper must have a
cool head, a quick eye, and, above all, a nice sense of balance;
but, given these things, it is open to all to succeed in some
measure, be they old or young, born near the north pole or the
equator.</p>

<p>These misapprehensions having been removed, it is expedient
to give a detailed description of what ski-jumping really is,
detailed instructions following later. Your attention is directed
to <a href="#fig030">Fig. 30</a>, p. 87.</p>

<p>This represents the section of an exceptionally suitable hill.
The jumper starts from the point A, and slides down to B, where
he leaps. The impetus gained from his journey from A to B,
coupled with the leap, sends him like a cannon ball through the
air to C, where he alights, and continues his course to D. Here
he usually stops himself by a Telemark or Christiania swing.
The distance from B to C is the measure of the length of the
jump, which may be anything up to 134ft. (the record to 1903),
according to the condition of the snow; shape, length, and
steepness of the hill; and the skill of the performer.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>It will be seen from this that the jump is not a jump <i>up</i>, but a
jump <i>down</i>; and it can readily be guessed that the difficulty lies
not so much in attaining great length as in retaining an upright
position on alighting. It takes considerable practice to make a
jump of 10ft. and stand, whilst anybody, provided the hill be
sufficiently steep, can jump 100ft. and fall.</p>

<p>Formerly, in Norway, the take-off used to be so placed that
the jumper alighted on the level, instead of on the hill side, and,
at first sight, such an arrangement might be thought to make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
matters easier. This is, however, very far from being the case.
A jump of anything over a few yards on the level involves a
considerable shock on alighting, which is not only unpleasant,
but renders “standing” a much more difficult matter, whilst,
in the event of a fall, serious injuries may result. On the other
hand, a jump downhill is attended by little or no shock on
alighting, which makes “standing” much easier, and falling
nothing more serious, in the vast majority of cases, than a long
roly-poly, broken by the snow.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that the slope and snow are suitable, the
chief requisites to success are a sense of balance and great daring.
The bolder, almost rasher, one is, the better. The outlook from
the top of a ski-jump of any magnitude is indeed alarming; for
note that the slope above the take-off is usually, and properly,
less steep than that below; and this means that a man of
ordinary stature standing at the point A (see diagram) sees
nothing of the slope B C, and his sensations, at least at first, are
as of one about to launch himself into a vast abyss. The danger
is, however, very largely imaginary, and a bold, coolly-calculated
spring vastly increases the chances of standing.</p>

<p>But to proceed from these general remarks to details. The ski
used for jumping should be suited to the runner in accordance
with the table given (p. 34). It is not easy to jump on ski
shorter than this, but they may very well be a trifle longer.
They should be rather on the heavy side, so as not to flutter
about in the air, and in order to withstand the strain to which
they are put on landing.</p>

<p>Any good firm binding may be used which permits of vertical
control over the ski.</p>

<p>No other special equipment is necessary.</p>

<p>The best snow for jumping is that which has been down for
some days, and which has been trodden by ski into a fairly firm
mass. The temperature of the air should be below freezing
point. On such a surface the ski will glide swiftly and at an
even rate of speed, sinking in about an inch or so&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
sufficiently to avoid side-slip. Sticky snow is dangerous, for the
reason that it is apt to occasion a nasty fall forwards, due to the
checking of the ski on alighting. For a similar reason, very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
deep soft snow is to be avoided, but it should be noted that
freshly fallen snow will often cease to stick after it has been
trodden down, especially should the temperature of the air be
low.</p>

<h4 id="HOW_TO_SELECT_AND_PREPARE_THE_HILL">HOW TO SELECT AND PREPARE THE HILL.</h4>

<p>As above mentioned, we frequently come across natural jumps
when on tour which require little or no preparation. On most
hill-sides there are places where sudden little dips occur. Give a
kick or two with the ski just below such a dip, so as to make the
step (see B, <a href="#fig030">Fig. 30</a>) more pronounced, and scrape together a
little snow on the top of it to raise it somewhat. Then with
half a minute’s stamping about the spot where you intend to
alight your preparations will be complete. Or, again, a stone
lying on a steep hill-side may be pressed into service after the
manner shown below.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig031" src="images/fig031.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span>&mdash;<i>Spraet hop</i>, made by piling snow above a stone lying on the hill-side.</p></div>

<p>Care must, of course, be taken that the top of the stone be
covered with snow. This sort of jump, the point of which turns
upwards, is called a <i>spraet hop</i> in Norwegian. It has the
effect of throwing the runner high into the air and is excellent
practice.</p>

<p>Edges of cornices (not, of course, large, dangerous ones),
stumps of trees, buried fences, &amp;c., &amp;c., can often be used for
take-offs, and the runner when on tour should keep his eyes open
for such, as they cause very amusing variations to ordinary
going.</p>

<p>But, though when a little skill has been acquired one should
practice on all sorts and kinds of places, it is probably best to
begin on something very easy, in order to gain confidence.</p>

<p>Choose, then, a good steep hill with a fair out-run at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
bottom. The gradient should be not less than 20 degrees, but
if it be steeper, all the better. It is a great mistake to begin on
too gentle a slope; a steep hill is far easier and far safer.</p>

<p>If you can find a hill with a little dip in it, well; but, if not,
never mind.</p>

<p>First select the place for building your take-off. This will
usually be at the edge of the dip, supposing you have found one.
If, however, the slope below this point is less than about double
the length of jump you contemplate, or, say, 20 yards in all, you
must place the take-off somewhat back from the extreme edge,
as shown in <a href="#fig030">Fig. 30</a>. But very likely you may not be able to
find any suitable hill with a dip in it. Never mind; a smooth
hill will do quite as well, or perhaps at first even better. Choose
a point on it 20 yards or so above the bottom, and build a long
take-off there in the shape shown below.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig032" src="images/fig032.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span>&mdash;A long take-off built on a smooth hill.</p></div>

<p>This is the form of hill on which you should practise for some
time. Do not at first let there be too much change between the
slope of the take-off and of the hill below, for the greater this
difference the more difficult will be the jump.</p>

<p>In choosing a hill it is, of course, desirable to select one as
smooth and free from difficulties as possible. In Nature, however,
such are seldom to be found, and one generally has to be
content with something less perfect. <i>It is, however, to be noted
that smoothness of surface and regularity of snow, whilst everywhere
desirable, are of special importance for a distance of ten</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
<i>yards above the spot selected for the take-off, and for about a
similar length below the point of alighting.</i></p>

<p>So, having chosen your hill, stand down it once or twice to
ascertain the best lie for the track. Then stamp the snow well
down with your ski at the two important places above mentioned,
making lanes down them about nine feet broad, and
filling up any hollows with good firm snow.</p>

<p>Then construct the take-off.</p>

<p>This may conveniently be done by making a little fence of
tree branches to the height of a foot or so, at right angles to
the track, and then filling up the space above them with layers
of snow and more tree branches placed flat. The structure
should be made as firm as possible, especially at the edge, and it
should combine with the hill above it, so as not to leave any
sudden angle at the join.</p>

<p>Begin with quite a little drop&mdash;about 1½ft. should be sufficient&mdash;and
as soon as you can “stand” over that build higher and
higher.</p>

<p>It is not <i>necessary</i> for practice to make a very wide take-off&mdash;2ft.
or 3ft. should be amply sufficient. And in general do not
waste valuable time which might be spent in jumping in building
a very elaborate affair.</p>

<p>The case is, of course, quite different if the hill is intended for
a competition. In this event too much care cannot be taken to
give every competitor an equal chance. <a href="#fig030">Fig. 30</a> shows an outline
of the Solberg jumping hill, near Christiania, which may
be taken as an example of what a hill ought to be. The snow on
a competition hill should be thoroughly stamped down with ski
<i>some hours before</i> the intended jumping. The take-off should
be 3 or 4 yards wide, and there should be plenty of men
both above and below the take-off armed with rakes to keep the
snow in order. The spectators should not be allowed to approach
too closely to the track. The illustrations opposite pp. 9 and 87
show how this is arranged in Norway.</p>

<h4 id="HOW_TO_JUMP">HOW TO JUMP.</h4>

<p>First study closely the figures in the diagram (<a href="#fig033">Fig 33</a>),
then read the following instructions, referring back from time
to time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span></p>

<p>Showing position of limbs and body when jumping.</p>

<p>N.B.&mdash;Many good ski-runners bring their ski quite level when
assuming the crouched position before jumping.</p>

<p>The ski are omitted for the sake of clearness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p></div>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Approach.</span></h5>

<p>Imagine yourself, then, standing some 20 or 30 yards above
the take-off. (The precise distance will, of course, depend on
the steepness of the hill and the speed which you wish to
attain; but as regards speed do not attempt too much at first;
it is difficult, of course, to give an exact measure, but a rate
of about 5 yards per second when approaching the edge of
the jump should be sufficient to begin with.) See that your
ski-fastenings are in order, and polish your ski a little on
the snow, or on some fir branches or other twigs, to remove any
lumps adhering to the bottom of them. <i>Be altogether without
fear</i>, and start.</p>

<p>Hold the ski close together, with one of them somewhat in
advance&mdash;say, with the heel of the one foot about in line with
the toe of the other.</p>

<p>About 15 yards or so before reaching the edge of the take-off
bend down, leaning a little forward (<a href="#fig033">see Fig. 33</a>). N.B.&mdash;About
this point many good jumpers bring their feet quite level.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Sats.</span></h5>

<p><i>Some few yards before reaching the edge swing the body
evenly forwards, at the same time straightening up.</i></p>

<p>This movement is termed the “sats.”</p>

<p>Note particularly that no attempt must be made to <i>lift</i> the
feet as in ordinary jumping. The body should be swung evenly
forwards, and at the same time straighten up from the crouched
to the erect position. The movement, if made vigorously, does,
in fact, cause a slight rising from the ground, but it is best not
to be too vigorous at first. <i>Unroll</i> yourself, so to speak, with an
easy sweep, avoiding all stiffness and jerking.</p>

<p>It may perhaps help you to understand what is meant if you
make an <i>attempt</i> to rise on the toes. You should not, indeed,
actually rise, but just at first, if you make an effort in that
direction, it will probably assist you to arrive at the knack of
the thing.</p>

<p>Another very important point is the timing of the movement.
The body should be nearly straight just as the take-off is left.
Therefore, as the movement itself takes time, the greater the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
speed at which you are travelling the earlier you must begin.
Whilst, on the other hand, the more vigorous the straightening
you intend to make the later you can defer it. You are, however,
advised to take things easily, especially at first, and to
aim rather at accuracy and elegance of style than at mere length.
Accordingly it will be necessary for you to begin the straightening
movement rather early. Remember when you first learnt to
shoot how often the tails of the rabbits and pheasants suffered.
For very similar reasons most beginners make the <i>sats</i> too late.</p>

<p>It follows from the above that the object of the <i>sats</i> is two-fold&mdash;firstly,
to increase the length of the jump, and, secondly,
to bring the body into the proper position for alighting. The
former is achieved by the straightening movement, and the
latter by the swing forward.</p>

<p>“But,” you ask, “why swing forward at all, why not keep
quite still?” The reason is that in descending all hills on
slippery things like ski the body must be kept quite straight
over them&mdash;or, in other words, at about right angles to the
slope on which they are travelling. This is sufficiently obvious.
But observe that in jumping the slope below the take-off is
considerably steeper than that above (<a href="#Page_93">p. 93</a>). The body
must accordingly be brought forward when passing from one to
the other, or a fall backwards will result. And such is, indeed,
the common fate of the beginner, whose tendency is invariably
to hang back!</p>

<p>Now look at the <i>spraet hop</i>, shown in <a href="#fig031">Fig. 31</a>. Here the
take-off itself is turned upwards, and the difference between its
direction and that of the slope below becomes greater than ever.
On such a jump it is especially necessary to swing well forwards,
for which reason it is the very best practice, for once
one has learnt to do that everything else is easy.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Position in the Air.</span></h5>

<p>The whole body should be straight and erect. So do not check
the straightening of the knees and thighs if you have not quite
finished your spring when you leave the take-off.</p>

<p>You will feel a compelling necessity to wave your arms round
and round when in the air. Everybody does so more or less,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
but, of course, your object should be to be reasonable in this.
Frantic waving looks very ugly. Endeavour to keep your ski
parallel to the slope below. There is always a tendency for the
toes to fly up and the heels to drag, which should be checked as
far as possible by pressing down the toes.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">On Alighting.</span></h5>

<p>Slide one foot forwards and the other backwards, relieving any
shock by a slight bending of the knees. This extending of the
feet is of great assistance in preserving the balance, and with a
little practice becomes almost instinctive.</p>

<p>Resume as soon as possible the normal position&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, ski close
together, one foot slightly in advance, body slightly crouched.
As soon as possible after reaching the level stop yourself by
making a Telemark or Christiania swing.</p>

<p><i>Points to be remembered</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. <i>Don’t be frightened.</i><br />
2. <i>Ski close together.</i><br />
3. <i>Swing forward, “unroll.”</i><br />
4. <i>Extend ski on alighting.</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Pay great attention to your “form,” which is all important,
as in rowing. Think of nothing else, and you will soon succeed.
At competitions the prize is not necessarily awarded to the
competitor who jumps furthest, even if he “stood” after alighting.
For if the jump was made in bad style assuredly it was a
fluke, and will seldom be repeated. All ski-jumpers fall more
or less, but it is equally a matter of surprise if the awkward
should “stand,” or the elegant and correct should fail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The style of jumping above recommended is that known in
Norway as the <i>Svæve</i>&mdash;one swoops motionless through the
air. It is certainly the prettiest, as well as the easiest to
learn. Another method, however, exists, known as the
<i>Trække op</i>, in which the leaper draws up his legs during his
flight, the object being to cover a longer distance. This, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
however, looks rather ugly (according, at least, to most people’s
ideas), and it is questionable whether one comes so much further
with it, after all.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_096" src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Leif Berg Jumping 90 Feet, at Glarus, ’05.</span></p>

<p class="copy"><i>Photo by E. Jeanrenaud.</i></p></div>

<p>But there is yet another point which it is far more difficult to
decide. Shall the runner jump with feet perfectly level or
shall he advance one of them as shown in <a href="#fig033">Fig. 33</a>? As will be
seen from the above description, the writer has not ventured to
speak positively as to this. On the one hand he has the
authority of one of the Holmenkollen judges for asserting that
it is best for the beginner to keep one foot in advance, whilst
on the other the general practice of many (if not, indeed, most)
first-class performers undoubtedly is to keep the feet quite level.
The advocates of the advanced foot contend that extreme steadiness
is of vital importance in taking the <i>sats</i>, and that, inasmuch
as the advanced foot position is admittedly steadier than the
other for glissading, it should also be adopted at this stage. In
addition to which they argue that, after the flight through the
air, when the runner first touches ground the advanced foot is
the more stable position of the two. On the other side, those
in favour of the “level-footed” style contend:&mdash;Firstly, that
to jump with one foot forward looks ugly (and the writer is
inclined to agree with them in this), and, secondly, that it
defeats its own ends, for it involves leaning forward on to
one foot, and accordingly jumping chiefly with it. And
this (they say) is conducive to a crooked flight through the air.
It is not, however, apparent how this is a necessary consequence,
for in ordinary long-jumping the spring is taken almost entirely
with one leg without the balance being in any way upset.</p>

<p>These are, however, theoretical matters, as to which the reader
interested may well be left to work out conclusions for himself,
whilst those who do not care for argument can console themselves
with the reflection that whichever style they like to adopt
they have excellent authority for their choice.</p>

<p>Is it possible that this is another question like that of the
bindings and that perhaps it does not matter so very much, after
all? Or may not both sides be right? May it not, for
example, be best to jump with level feet when the track is
smooth and easy, but with one foot forward when it is irregular
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
and difficult? On the Continent rough jumping on tour has
hardly yet “caught on,” everything being regarded, so to speak,
through competition spectacles. And perhaps this is why the
level-footed style is there so much insisted on. He, however,
who limits himself to jumping at competitions and on elaborately
prepared tracks will never be a really clever ski-runner,
and will miss a vast deal of the possibilities and pleasures of
this branch of the sport.

<h2 id="SKI_MOUNTAINEERING">SKI MOUNTAINEERING.<br />

<span class="large">By <span class="smcap">W. R. Rickmers</span>.</span></h2>

<p>It is quite impossible to define exactly what constitutes mountaineering
as apart from strolling and short excursions, but its
chief characteristics are distance from human dwellings and
human help, and the presence of special dangers. The term
“mountaineering” comprises a multitude of rules which teach
how to overcome the difficulties and how to avoid the dangers
of rising ground. Mountaineering is a science admirably expounded
in a series of classical text-books, the result of the
experience of thousands of climbers, and the essence of a literature
of over 10,000 volumes. From a subjective point of view
mountaineering begins when a wanderer, approaching a hill or
mountain, is conscious of the fact that he will meet with special
conditions which demand a special knowledge. And the
minimum required of a man who wishes to be called a “mountaineer,”
a good mountain climber, an expert, is that as to the
theory he should have “Dent” at his finger-ends (C. T. Dent,
Mountaineering, Badminton Library); and as to the practice, he
must be a man who can be trusted to attempt any peak in the
world without endangering the lives of his companions.</p>

<p>Now, it would be absurd to try to teach mountaineering in a
chapter of this book, for it takes ten years at least to make a
mountaineer. Still less dare I insult the mountaineer by advising
him how to behave in his element, for he will not go high
and far until he feels at home on the planks. By the time he
has mastered the technicalities of ski-ing, he knows everything
about the outfit which suits him best, and about his line of

conduct on any expedition he may plan. My remarks on the
subject in hand cannot, therefore, be anything but a series of very
general reflections and impressions, simply intended as a loud
warning to ski-runners that they should study “Alpinism,” and
as a gentle reminder to mountaineers, that ski-running is a
somewhat tricky complication of their art. Why should I tell
the latter what type of ski to take on long tours, seeing that he
knows on which kind he travels best; why should he ask me
about his ice-axe when he is sure to take one or not according
to the object in view?<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>Ski-runners, unless they are climbing experts, or accompanied
by such, must confine themselves to the usual practice-grounds
and safe excursions, for only a mountaineer can decide on the
spot whether hill craft is necessary or not. To explain how he
arrives at this decision would mean a very thick volume. The
ski-runner, therefore, who wishes to form a correct opinion of
his own should make up his mind to learn from amateurs, guides,
and books how to look about, think, and behave when he leaves
the beaten track where multitudes are accustomed to go unthinking
and unadvised. My random observations are to impress
him with that necessity, and for the mountaineer they shall be
an epitome of familiar principles.</p>

<p>In the winter the problem of the avalanche eclipses all others.
The rule to go only with guides or experienced friends disposes
of the general advice respecting glaciers, crevasses, slips, strategy,
and discipline, for in these things a man must train himself
during many seasons. The rule that only good ski-runners dare
aspire towards high peaks saves a long repetition of detail as to
outfit.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The ski-runner-mountaineer ought always to be a man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
who, during his apprenticeship, knew something of cold, hunger,
slow companions, and broken ski. To have no spare gloves and
no provisions, to fall where one ought to stand, to step on a
hollow, or to risk a dashing slide, may have merely disagreeable
results two miles from home; but the same omissions and commissions
can be suicidal, nay, even criminal, when ten miles
from the nearest human habitation. If you wish to kill, go
alone, and kill yourself, for every party of mountaineers suffers
for the thoughtlessness of each of its members, while the greatest
skill or ability of one of them is as nothing in the balance of
fate when the whole has to bear the inadequacy of the lowest
unit.</p>

<p>Extreme suspicion and wariness are the only correct attitude
towards the mountains in their winter garb. The number of
factors which combine to prepare or prevent an avalanche is
truly bewildering, and any single one of them may be the prime
mover or the reliable safeguard in a given instance. And this
one was perhaps overlooked in weighing the evidence. <i>The
secret of the avalanche is the breaking strain and snapping
point of an unseen tension.</i> Avalanches owe their growth and
collapse to some or all of the following indications: The
angle of the slope; the surface of the ground; the quantity
of the snow; the snow of a month ago, of yesterday,
and to-day; the temperature and the wind of a month ago,
yesterday, and today, while the snow fell, or before it fell, or
after it had fallen. And to consummate or prevent the catastrophy
there are, in conjunction with the above, the temperature
at the time of our arrival on the spot, the weight of the party,
its methods of walking or ski-ing, and sundry other accidents.
So many possibilities produce tantalising doubt rather than
definite conviction, and more often than not a slope, which
presents all the visible elements of danger, may be perfectly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
harmless. On the other hand, well-known guides have walked
into mouse-traps because one exceptional condition had altered
the internal character of a particular slope which, throughout
their lives, they had known as perfectly safe. A strong sense
of human weakness is therefore the proper frame of mind towards
the mysterious and overwhelming power of the snow.</p>

<p>The mountaineer must condense the theory of avalanches into
a few comprehensive rules of thumb, and when in doubt he
must give the benefit to himself and not to the avalanche.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suspicious.</span>&mdash;Every open slope of about 25 deg. or steeper,
and <i>all new snow in warm weather</i>. A thaw after a heavy fall
of snow is the most common cause of the thick and heavy slides
known as ground avalanches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dangerous.</span>&mdash;Every heavy accumulation of snow at an angle
of 40 deg. or more, on long open slopes, and in gullies. At lesser
angles all snow which lies on a hard and smooth surface (grass,
earth, old snow, crust, ice, &amp;c.). Hard snow under the lee of
ridges. This is liable to crack and to become suddenly transformed
into what looks like a huge waterfall of lumps of sugar.
Therefore, one ought to cross such slopes as high up as possible.
The cornice which overhangs the ridge is more dangerous to
those who walk <i>on</i> it than to those <i>under</i> it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Safe.</span>&mdash;All slopes under 25 deg; all slopes evenly dotted with
trees or rocks; almost every perfectly homogeneous snow not
deeper than 2ft. which lies on a rough surface (screes, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>More cannot be said without conjuring up a flood of detail.
This experience and acquired instinct must fill in. The tourist
can find almost daily an opportunity of making experiments on a
small scale, though he should not forget that a cubic yard of
snow can dislocate his arm or break his leg.</p>

<p>As an instance, showing the effect of surface, I may mention
that, in the Alpine spring, the grass slopes send down in huge
avalanches the solid layer accumulated and consolidated during
the winter. At the same time the firm, wet snow of exactly
the same texture which lies on screes remains perfectly safe, and
affords splendid ski-ing. It never slips off, but gradually melts,
evaporates, and vanishes as the summer draws near.</p>

<p>The only exact method of dealing with avalanches would be to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
make “avalanche maps” of popular centres. In these maps
the slopes and gullies which are always bad are coloured, let us
say, red. A blue slope would be dangerous under such and such
conditions; a green slope becomes threatening in the spring, &amp;c.
On these maps all those expeditions should be marked which
can be guaranteed as safe.</p>

<p>The fear of the avalanche must always be before the ski-runner’s
conscience. All the rest is a matter of well-defined
dogma, of strict attention to well-known precautions, which
belong to the routine of every mountaineer deserving of the
name.</p>

<p>(1) Never go alone; three is the minimum.</p>

<p>(2) One man at least must be an Alpine climber of experience.</p>

<p>(3) All members of the party must be equal in skill.</p>

<p>These three commandments are the essence. Let a few comments
suffice.</p>

<p>(1) The solitary mountaineer is a fool. This is an article of
faith. Permissible exceptions are rare.</p>

<p>(2) The experienced leader will tell his friends all about the
crevasses, outfit, provisions, the importance of an early start,
the duty of keeping together, and the courage to turn back
before the approach of the night or bad weather. He will ask
if everyone has his goggles, spare gloves, provisions, snow-helmets,
repairing tools. He will take from everyone the promise
to be strictly obeyed.</p>

<p>(3) This is a necessary complement to 1 and 2. Ten stumblers
of equal proficiency are a good party, for they will generally get
as far as they deserve. Nine good men and one stumbler are
bad, for they will probably make that one poor man feel worse
than he is.</p>

<p>On long tours only persons can go who do not fall when they
have the will not to fall. He is not a fit companion for difficult
expeditions who is not sure that he can keep on his feet throughout
the day. A mountaineer never has a spill unless he forgets
himself, his companions, or his surroundings.</p>

<div class="small">
<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In our experience by far the commonest form of winter avalanche
occurs when a ski-runner crosses (or some other influence disturbs) a long
steep slope of <i>freshly-fallen</i> snow. The weight of the runner is the last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
straw which causes the slenderly coherent mass to snap. It does so with
a curious report, something like the cracking of thick ice on a frozen
lake. Below the dividing line, which may be half a mile long, the snow
slides off the hill-side much as it slides off the roof of a house, forming
itself into thick slabs like paving stones which accumulate one on top
of the other, and which ultimately overwhelm the runner. The snow
usually breaks only a short distance above the runner, and consequently, in
the event of an accident, search should first be made in that part of the
mass which is highest up the hill.</p>

<p>Freshly-fallen snow is accordingly quite the most serious danger of ski-running,
and, inasmuch as it usually affords but poor going, it is seldom
worth while venturing far on very steep ground after a recent fall. After
a few days of fine weather, however, the snow settles down, the avalanches
run off, and what remains becomes firmer and more crystalline in structure.
Under the pressure of its own weight, and owing to the peculiar property of
<i>regelation</i> which solid water possesses, the new fall attaches itself to the
old crusts, and the conditions become, comparatively speaking, safe.</p>

<p>It is a common saying amongst the Swiss that it is unsafe to venture
above the tree-line, as long as any snow is left clinging to the trees on
the sunny side of the valleys. This rough test we have found to be a very
useful one.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

<h4 id="ANTIDOTES_TO_STICKING">ANTIDOTES TO “STICKING” AND AIDS TO
CLIMBING.</h4>

<p>In warm weather snow is apt to stick to the bottom of the ski
(see page 22). It accumulates there in large watery clods, and
renders progress very slow and laborious. Under such circumstances
the advice commonly given is not to go out at all, and unless there
is a prospect of better things, either in the shade or higher up, it
is certainly best to stop at home. Nevertheless, the boundary line
between sticking and not sticking is an extremely narrow one, and,
moreover, one is not always sitting comfortably indoors when the
trouble begins. It is therefore important to consider what is to be
done to avoid or cure it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Waxing the ski</b> is the simplest plan, and proves effective in the
great majority of cases. It is true that with waxed ski hill-climbing
may become a matter of considerable difficulty, for the
wax is apt to carry matters too far, and to make the surface
unduly slippery. But anything is better than carrying all that
dead weight of snow, and by using only a little wax under the foot
(where the sticking chiefly occurs), by choosing an easy gradient,
and by side stepping, &amp;c., one can generally manage to get along
somehow.</p>

<p>Various kinds of wax are sold for this purpose, and all are more
or less efficacious. There is, however, a difficulty with the solid
kinds in inducing them to “bite” when the ski are cold and
wet, and the writer prefers the semi-liquid variety sold in tubes.
A tube of wax, plus its attendant piece of rag, takes up very little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
room in the pocket or rucksack, and its weight is in no way commensurate
with that of the lumps of snow which it is not infrequently
its office to prevent.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Sealskin.</b>&mdash;From time immemorial seal’s (or elk’s) skin has
been attached to the bottom of the ski. The hairs, set towards
the heel serve the double purpose of preventing the ski slipping
backwards, and of keeping the surface free from sticky
snow. Until quite recently it has been usual to fix the skin
permanently; but whilst this works fairly well for certain
purposes, it is open to many objections. The hair is a very
serious impediment, both down-hill and on the level, for it not
only reduces the speed, but, owing to its inherent “wobbliness,”
it renders steering and balancing much more difficult. Then,
again, the hair soon wears out, a day of hard snow being sufficient
to quite spoil it; or it tears, or, being wet, the weather turns colder
and it freezes solid. But perhaps the most serious objection of all
is the nasty <i>feeling</i> of a skin-clad ski. There is a certain cleanness
and crispness about the movement of the plain wood through the
snow which one learns to love, and which one sorely misses.
Besides which there is much art in getting up-hill to the best
advantage on uncovered ski, and this keeps one’s mind busy, and
greatly alleviates the labours of the climb; whereas with the skin
any duffer can get along, and climbing becomes pure drudgery.
It is, however, certain that, given a long and steep ascent where
much zig-zagging is necessary, or even an only moderately steep
slope and hard snow, one can with the skin arrive far more quickly
and easily at the top than without it. It will, therefore, either
when attached permanently or when detachable as about to be
described, be found to be of great value for long and arduous
mountain tours on steep Alpine ground. But even in the Alps,
under all ordinary circumstances, where ski-running, and not the
ascent of any particularly difficult summit, is the object in view, and
where it is of no consequence whether one arrives an hour sooner or
later, there is no sense in encumbering oneself with unnecessary
gear and spoiling the pleasant “feel” of the bare ash.</p>

<p>On undulating ground, where one can usually go straight up and
down hill (as in most parts of Norway), nobody nowadays dreams
of using skin in any shape or form.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Detachable Sealskin</b> is quite a recent invention, and is vastly
preferable to the fixed article. For it can be used for a long climb,
and removed when the summit is reached.</p>

<p>Thus a strip of the material mounted on webbing can be attached
to the bottom of the ski by means of a loop over the point, a strap
at the heel end, and a few transverse straps. But the plan is open
to the objection that the skin is apt to slip about sideways, and that
the fixing of it is troublesome, and takes time.</p>

<p>The latest method of fixing is that invented by Messrs. Sohm
and Madlener, and is highly recommended by those who have
tried it. But it involves boring two holes through each ski&mdash;an
unpardonable sacrilege in the eyes of some people. Surely, however,
if we are going to commit the outrage of using sealskin at all
we may just as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb, and bore
holes or do anything else which may assist us in our fell (joke!)
design.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>The detachable skin of Herren Sohm and Madlener</b> is sewn
on to stout webbing, and is only about half as long as the ski themselves.
It is attached to the ski immediately in front of the foot, and
reaches from there to the back end. The arrangements for fixing
it are extremely ingenious, and permit of its being attached or
removed with great rapidity. The photographs and drawings
(p. 108) show exactly what they are.</p>

<p>A hole is bored in the ski just in front of the binding; and
another about halfway between it and the heel end of the ski.
Through each of these holes a bolt passes, the bottom of which is
shaped like a flat sort of button. The bolt sticks up through the
ski; and it is threaded and fitted with a wing-nut. (See Fig. <i>a</i>.)
When not required the button is screwed by means of the wing-nut
into a recess cut for its reception in the bottom of the ski.</p>

<p>The front part of the skin is buttoned to the front bolt, the middle
part to the second bolt, whilst the heel end has a strap sewn on to
it by means of which the whole is first stretched perfectly taut,
and then secured by passing the strap round the heel of the ski,
and fixing it to a catch on the top of the ski. The strap is fitted
with eye-holes, and the catch is of the simple, but ingenious construction
shown in Fig. <i>b</i>, and in the photos.</p>

<p>The front part of the skin, of course, requires protection. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
is afforded by soldering two pieces of sheet brass together so as to
form a sharp tent-shaped <span class="v">V</span>.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Upper side of middle of skin, showing button-hole.</p></div>

<p class="copy">The measurements, when not otherwise stated, are in millimètres.</p></div>

<p>The skin, mounted on its webbing, is placed between the jaws of
the <span class="v">V</span> which are then closed and secured by a couple of copper
rivets. (See Figs. <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>.) The “button-holes” on the skin are
not, of course, of the ordinary kind. The front one is shown in
Fig. <i>d</i>. The second one in Fig. <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>The front “button-hole” is cut out of the upper part of the
tent-shaped brass <span class="v">V</span> as shown in Fig. <i>d</i>.</p>

<p>The second “button-hole” (Fig. <i>f</i>) allows the button to slide
backwards and forwards in it so as to permit of the skin being
pulled quite taut. This “button-hole” is made by simply cutting
a hole and slot in another piece of sheet brass, and attaching it to
the skin by means of rivets. (See Figs. <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>.) N.B.&mdash;Only
four rivets are shown in this drawing, but probably it is better to
make the slot a little longer and to add another rivet at each side.</p>

<p>In fitting this kind of detachable skin to a pair of ordinary ski,
it is probably best to fill up the customary groove cut in the bottom
of the ski. The ski will then be devoted exclusively to steep mountain
work where it is in any case advantageous to dispense with the
groove. (See page 33.) If, however, it is desired to retain the
groove it will be advisable to make the button holes extra strong,
or else to make them up so as to fit close against the wood.</p>

<p>It will be observed (as was mentioned above) that the skin only
covers about half the under surface of the ski. To prevent snow
sticking to the uncovered part in warm weather, a liberal coating of
wax may be applied, or else (as Herr Sohm advises) the whole of
the bottom of the ski may be painted with smooth and hard
enamel. This gives a very fast surface for running on, and of
course no slipping back need be feared when walking up-hill with
the skin attached.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Climbing Irons.</b>&mdash;Herr Sohm recommends the use of
climbing irons invented by him in combination with his
detachable skin. The object of the irons is to prevent slipping on
very steep icy slopes. The writer has had no experience of
these, and, as criticism without practical knowledge is seldom
of much value, he prefers to leave the reader to try them or leave
them alone, just as he pleases. This much may, however, be safely
assumed that these appliances (like the skin itself) can only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
be of value to the skilled ski mountaineer desirous of making long
and difficult excursions in the high Alps. They are (as Herr Sohm
himself insists) quite unnecessary on ordinary ground, and are
certainly not for the beginner.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig035" src="images/fig035.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35.</span>&mdash;Sohm’s Climbing Irons.</p>

<p>The measurements are in millimètres. See also the photos, <a href="#Page_108">page 108</a>.</p></div>

<p>The climbing irons are made of some strong metal unaffected by
rust, and their shape and the method of fixing them in conjunction
with the skin is shown clearly in the accompanying diagrams.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Tying a piece of rope to the bottom of the ski</b> is resorted
to by some in order to help them to get up-hill. The writer has,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
however, never found this to be of much use. It is true that if
plenty of rope is used, and if it is properly fixed (no easy matter
by the way), it largely obviates slipping back; but it also seriously
hinders slipping forwards, and necessitates a lifting or heavy
dragging of the ski at every step. Snow is very apt to stick to the
rope, and of course no glissading with it is possible. The net
loss seems therefore to be greater than the gain, though possibly
there may be occasions when the reader may find something of the
sort useful. The plan has at least the merit of cheapness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Dipping part of the ski into water</b> is also recommended
by some in order to help climbing, the idea being to form a lump
of ice on the bottom, which may be removed when the summit is
reached. But this, too, is open to much the same objections as the
rope, and is scarcely worth while. If it is to be adopted, it is well
to be provided with a metal paper-knife, or something of the kind,
to scrape off the ice, and, incidentally, it may be here mentioned
that some sort of scraping appliance will always be found useful;
for cleaning one’s ski with the stick or an ordinary knife takes a
long time, besides being apt to injure both the wood and the
blade.</p>

<p>(1) Abusing the snow. The better the ski-runner the less
he complains, and <i>vice versâ</i>. Notice how the good men

<p>(2) Continuing a tour when danger may be expected.
Only greenhorns and fools do so. Turn back, and try
another day.</p>

<p>(3) Waxing ski when snow is <i>just</i> binding. Best not. The

colder higher up.</p></blockquote>

<p>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Technique.</span></p>

Don’t go too steeply. Go slowly, but keep at it.</p>

<p>(3) Rushing up in front of others when on tour. Don’t
show off. Probably you are one of the worst of
the party; in any case, you are only annoying the
others.</p>

<p>(4) Side stepping, ski cross. Raise heel of lower ski.

<h4 id="SKI_RUNNING_ETIQUETTE">SKI-RUNNING ETIQUETTE.</h4>

<p>Introductions are very informal on the snow.</p>

<p>You may ask anybody for advice, and be certain of receiving a
polite answer, provided that you yourself are polite, and that your
question is not idiotic.</p>

<p>If you contemplate joining a touring party, you should ask
somebody who is going, and who has already made a tour with you,
whether you are likely to be welcome. If he hesitates, don’t go.
If he assents, go by all means, even though you may be doubtful
whether you are up to the work in hand.</p>

<p>You should not instantly rush to the assistance of a lady who
may have fallen. Do not let your gallantry get the better of your
common sense.</p>

<p>In Norway ladies put on their own ski, and manage their own
bindings, and it is not good manners to offer to assist them.
Would that the custom extended to Switzerland!</p>

<p>However amusing your conversation may be, you should refrain
from chattering during a long climb. Not everybody’s wind or
everybody’s temper is perfect.</p>

<p>You will not add to your popularity on tour by continually
accepting hospitality at the hands of others, especially if your
water-bottle be small, and you carry no repairing outfit.</p>

<p>You should pay up punctually, and without demur, to the man
who finances a touring party; it is at least ten to one that he
is out of pocket, anyway.</p>

<p>It is a gross breach of manners to tread on the back of another
man’s ski. You should at once apologise and fall back five yards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>You should not come plumping over a jump which others have
been at some pains to construct, without first asking their leave,
and it is always your solemn duty to repair as well as possible any
damage you may occasion to the track.</p>

<p>Unless you are really a very good runner, it is better not to
imitate too closely the Norwegian style of dress. People may be
disappointed.</p>

<p>Always be polite in your dealings with foreigners, and you will
seldom have cause to complain of their want of manners.

 <i>Ski</i> is really the same word as the English <i>skid</i>, meaning a slide, or
something to slide upon, the affinity being even greater in the Swedish term
<i>skid</i> (plural, <i>skidor</i>), meaning slides or skates. Originally it doubtless
springs from the Finnish <i>subsi</i> or <i>suksi</i>, by which appellation the ski were
probably known long before their introduction to Scandinavia.</p></div>

 The ski which are suitable for ordinary excursions on undulating
ground are not necessarily equally useful for long mountain climbs.
In the one case ski-running pure and simple is the object in view, in the
other the ski are merely a means to an end&mdash;the ascent of some difficult
summit or pass. Some remarks as to the kind of instrument which may
be found serviceable for the latter purpose are to be found at p. 34, and in
the chapter on “Aids to Climbing.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

 This, perhaps, scarcely goes far enough. The outfit suitable for undulating
wooded ground on which a runner may attain to great skill is not
equally serviceable high up. In particular, a cap covering most of the
face and neck, smoked glasses or the simple arrangement described on
p. 50, a light wind-jacket of some sort, extra-thick gloves, extra-thick
socks, and extra-stout nailed boots are essential. The runner should
accustom himself to carrying a large heavy rucksack, which is a disagreeable,
but, alas! an indispensable, companion on a long mountain
tour.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
